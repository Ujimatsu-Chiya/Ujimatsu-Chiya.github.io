## 题目
### Triangles with non rational sides and integral area

Consider the triangle with sides $\sqrt 5$, $\sqrt {65}$ and $\sqrt {68}$.
It can be shown that this triangle has area $9$.

$S(n)$ is the sum of the areas of  all triangles with sides $\sqrt{1+b^2}$, $\sqrt {1+c^2}$ and $\sqrt{b^2+c^2}\,$ (for positive integers $b$ and $c$) that have an integral area not exceeding $n$.

The example triangle has $b=2$ and $c=8$.

$S(10^6)=18018206$.

Find $S(10^{10})$.

### Triangles with non rational sides and integral area

Consider the triangle with sides √5, √65 and √68. It can be shown that this triangle has area 9.
S(n) is the sum of the areas of all triangles with sides √(1+b^2), √(1+c^2) and √(b^2+c^2) (for positive integers b and c ) that have an integral area not exceeding n.
The example triangle has b=2 and c=8.
S(10^6)=18018206.
Find S(10^10).
