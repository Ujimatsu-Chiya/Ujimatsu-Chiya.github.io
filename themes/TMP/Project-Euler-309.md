## 题目
### Integer Ladders

In the classic "Crossing Ladders" problem, we are given the lengths <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> of two ladders resting on the opposite walls of a narrow, level street. We are also given the height <var>h</var> above the street where the two ladders cross and we are asked to find the width of the street (<var>w</var>).

<div align="center"><img src="project/images/p309_ladders.gif" class="dark_img" alt="p309_ladders.gif" /></div>

Here, we are only concerned with instances where all four variables are positive integers.<br />
For example, if <var>x</var> = 70, <var>y</var> = 119 and <var>h</var> = 30, we can calculate that <var>w</var> = 56.

In fact, for integer values <var>x</var>, <var>y</var>, <var>h</var> and 0 < <var>x</var> < <var>y</var> < 200, there are only five triplets (<var>x</var>,<var>y</var>,<var>h</var>) producing integer solutions for <var>w</var>:<br />
(70, 119, 30), (74, 182, 21), (87, 105, 35), (100, 116, 35) and (119, 175, 40).

For integer values <var>x</var>, <var>y</var>, <var>h</var> and 0 < <var>x</var> < <var>y</var> < 1 000 000, how many triplets (<var>x</var>,<var>y</var>,<var>h</var>) produce integer solutions for <var>w</var>?

In the classic “Crossing Ladders” problem, we are given the lengths x and y of two ladders resting on the opposite walls of a narrow, level street. We are also given the height h above the street where the two ladders cross and we are asked to find the width of the street (w).

For integer values x, y, h and 0 < x < y < 1 000 000, how many triplets (x,y,h) produce integer solutions for w?
