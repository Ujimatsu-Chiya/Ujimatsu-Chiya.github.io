# Project Euler 413
## 题目
### One-child Numbers

We say that a <var>d</var>-digit positive number (no leading zeros) is a one-child number if exactly one of its sub-strings is divisible by <var>d</var>.

For example, 5671 is a 4-digit one-child number. Among all its sub-strings 5, 6, 7, 1, 56, 67, 71, 567, 671 and 5671, only 56 is divisible by 4.<br />
Similarly, 104 is a 3-digit one-child number because only 0 is divisible by 3.<br />
1132451 is a 7-digit one-child number because only 245 is divisible by 7.

Let F(<var>N</var>) be the number of the one-child numbers less than <var>N</var>.<br />
We can verify that F(10) = 9, F(10^3) = 389 and F(10^7) = 277674.

Find F(10^19).

### One-child Numbers

We say that a d-digit positive number (no leading zeros) is a one-child number if exactly one of its sub-strings is divisible by d.
For example, 5671 is a 4-digit one-child number.
