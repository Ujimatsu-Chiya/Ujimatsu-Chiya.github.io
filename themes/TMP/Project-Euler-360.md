# Project Euler 360
## 题目
### Scary Sphere


Given two points (x_1,y_1,z_1) and (x_2,y_2,z_2) in three dimensional space, the <b>Manhattan distance</b>  between those points is defined as <br /> |x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2|+|z_1-z_2|.


Let C(<var>r</var>) be a sphere with radius <var>r</var> and center in the origin O(0,0,0).<br />
Let I(<var>r</var>) be the set of all points with integer coordinates on the surface of C(<var>r</var>).<br />
Let S(<var>r</var>) be the sum of the Manhattan distances of all elements of I(<var>r</var>) to the origin O.


E.g. S(45)=34518.


Find S(10^10).
