## 题目
### Incenter and circumcenter of triangle

Given an integer sided triangle ABC:<br />
Let I be the incenter of ABC.<br />
Let D be the intersection between the line AI and the circumcircle of ABC (A ≠ D).

We define F(<var>L</var>) as the sum of BC for the triangles ABC that satisfy AC = DI and BC \le <var>L</var>.

For example, F(15) = 45 because the triangles ABC with (BC,AC,AB) = (6,4,5), (12,8,10), (12,9,7), (15,9,16) satisfy the conditions.

Find F(10^9).
