## 题目
### Chromatic Conundrum

Let F(<var>r</var>,<var>c</var>,<var>n</var>) be the number of ways to colour a rectangular grid with <var>r</var> rows and <var>c</var> columns using at most <var>n</var> colours such that no two adjacent cells share the same colour. Cells that are diagonal to each other are not considered adjacent.

For example, F(2,2,3) = 18, F(2,2,20) = 130340, and F(3,4,6) = 102923670.

Let S(<var>r</var>,<var>c</var>,<var>n</var>) = $\sum_{k=1}^{n}$ F(<var>r</var>,<var>c</var>,<var>k</var>).

For example, S(4,4,15) mod 10^9+7 = 325951319.

Find S(9,10,1112131415) mod 10^9+7.

## 题目
### Chromatic Conundrum

Let F(r,c,n) be the number of ways to color a rectangular grid with r rows and c columns using at most n colors such that no two adjacent cells share the same color. Cells that are diagonal to each other are not considered adjacent.
For example, F(2,2,3) = 18, F(2,2,20) = 130340, and F(3,4,6) = 102923670.
Let S(r,c,n) = $\sum_{k=1}^{n} F(r,c,k)$.
For example, S(4,4,15) mod 10^9+7 = 325951319.
Find S(9,10,1112131415) mod 10^9+7.
