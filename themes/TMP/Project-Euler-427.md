## 题目
### n-sequences

A sequence of integers S = {s_<var>i</var>} is called an <var>n-sequence</var> if it has <var>n</var> elements and each element s_<var>i</var> satisfies 1 \le s_<var>i</var> \le <var>n</var>. Thus there are <var>n</var>^<var>n</var> distinct <var>n</var>-sequences in total.
For example, the sequence S = {1, 5, 5, 10, 7, 7, 7, 2, 3, 7} is a 10-sequence.

For any sequence S, let L(S) be the length of the longest contiguous subsequence of S with the same value.
For example, for the given sequence S above, L(S) = 3, because of the three consecutive 7's.

Let <var>f</var>(<var>n</var>) = \sum L(S) for all <var>n</var>-sequences S.

For example, <var>f</var>(3) = 45, <var>f</var>(7) = 1403689 and <var>f</var>(11) = 481496895121.

Find <var>f</var>(7 500 000) mod 1 000 000 009.

### n-sequences

A sequence of integers S = {s_i} is called an <em>n-sequence</em> if it has n elements and each element s_i satisfies 1 \le s_i \le n. Thus there are n^n distinct n-sequences in total. For example, the sequence S = {1, 5, 5, 10, 7, 7, 7, 2, 3, 7} is a 10-sequence.
For any sequence S, let L(S) be the length of the longest contiguous subsequence of S with the same value. For example, for the given sequence S above, L(S) = 3, because of the three consecutive 7’s.
Let f(n) = \sum L(S) for all n-sequences S.
For example, f(3) = 45, f(7) = 1403689 and f(11) = 481496895121.
Find f(7&nbsp;500&nbsp;000) mod 1&nbsp;000&nbsp;000&nbsp;009.
