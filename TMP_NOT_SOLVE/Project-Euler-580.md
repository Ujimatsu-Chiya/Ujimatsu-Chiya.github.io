### Squarefree Hilbert numbers



A <b>Hilbert number</b> is any positive integer of the form $4k+1$ for integer $k\geq 0$.  We shall define a <i>squarefree Hilbert number</i> as a Hilbert number which is not divisible by the square of any Hilbert number other than one.  For example, $117$ is a squarefree Hilbert number, equaling $9\times13$.  However $6237$ is a Hilbert number that is not squarefree in this sense, as it is divisible by $9^2$.  The number $3969$ is also not squarefree, as it is divisible by both $9^2$ and $21^2$.  


There are $2327192$ squarefree Hilbert numbers below $10^7$. <br />
How many squarefree Hilbert numbers are there below $10^{16}$?
