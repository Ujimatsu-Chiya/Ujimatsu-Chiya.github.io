## 题目
### Open chess positions


A position in chess is an (orientated) arrangement of chess pieces placed on a chessboard of given size. In the following, we consider all positions in which $n$ pawns are placed on a  $n \times n$  
board in such a way, that there is a single pawn in every row and every column.



We call such a position an <i>open</i> position, if a rook, starting at the (empty) lower left corner and using only moves towards the right or upwards, can reach the upper right corner without moving onto any field occupied by a pawn. 

Let $f(n)$ be the number of open positions for a $n \times n$ chessboard.<br />
For example, $f(3)=2$, illustrated by the two open positions for a $3  \times 3$ chessboard below.


<table align="center"><tr><td><img src="project/images/p628_chess4.png" alt="Open position 1" /></td><td width="60"></td><td><img src="project/images/p628_chess5.png" alt="Open position 2" /></td>
</tr></table>
You are also given $f(5)=70$.
Find $f(10^8)$ modulo $1\,008\,691\,207$.
