## 题目
### St. Petersburg Lottery


A gambler decides to participate in a special lottery. In this lottery the gambler plays a series of one or more games.<br />
Each game costs <var>m</var> pounds to play and starts with an initial pot of 1 pound. The gambler flips an unbiased coin. Every time a head appears, the pot is doubled and the gambler continues. When a tail appears, the game ends and the gambler collects the current value of the pot. The gambler is certain to win at least 1 pound, the starting value of the pot, at the cost of <var>m</var> pounds, the initial fee.

The game ends if the gambler's fortune falls below <var>m</var> pounds.
Let <var>p_m</var>(<var>s</var>) denote the probability that the gambler will never run out of money in this lottery given an initial fortune <var>s</var> and the cost per game <var>m</var>.<br />
For example <var>p</var>_2(2) ≈ 0.2522, <var>p</var>_2(5) ≈ 0.6873 and <var>p</var>_6(10 000) ≈ 0.9952 (note: <var>p_m</var>(<var>s</var>) = 0 for <var>s</var> < <var>m</var>).

Find <var>p</var>_15(10^9) and give your answer rounded to 7 decimal places behind the decimal point in the form 0.abcdefg.
