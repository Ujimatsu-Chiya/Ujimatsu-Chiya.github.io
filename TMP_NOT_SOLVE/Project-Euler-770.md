# Project Euler 770
## 题目
### Delphi Flip



A and B play a game. A has originally $1$ gram of gold and B has an unlimited amount.
Each round goes as follows:

<ul>
<li>
A chooses and displays, $x$, a nonnegative real number no larger than the amount of gold that A has.</li>
<li>
Either B chooses to TAKE. Then A gives B $x$ grams of gold.</li>
<li>
Or B chooses to GIVE. Then B gives A $x$ grams of gold.</li>
</ul>

B TAKEs $n$ times and GIVEs $n$ times after which the game finishes.

Define $g(X)$ to be the smallest value of $n$ so that A can guarantee to have at least $X$ grams of gold at the end of the game. You are given $g(1.7) = 10$.


Find $g(1.9999)$.
