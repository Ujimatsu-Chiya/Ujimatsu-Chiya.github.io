## 题目
### Angular Bisectors

<span style="font-size:11pt;">
</span>Given is an integer sided triangle ABC with sides a \le b \le c. 
(AB = c, BC = a and AC = b).<br />
The angular bisectors of the triangle intersect the sides at points E, F and G (see picture below).

<div align="center">
<img src="project/images/p257_bisector.gif" class="dark_img" alt="p257_bisector.gif" /><br /></div>

The segments EF, EG and FG partition the triangle ABC into four smaller triangles: AEG, BFE, CGF and EFG.<br />
It can be proven that for each of these four triangles the ratio area(ABC)/area(subtriangle) is rational.<br />
However, there exist triangles for which some or all of these ratios are integral.


How many triangles ABC with perimeter\le100,000,000 exist so that the ratio area(ABC)/area(AEG) is integral?
