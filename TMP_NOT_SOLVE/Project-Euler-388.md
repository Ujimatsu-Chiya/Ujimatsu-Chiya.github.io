# Project Euler 388
## 题目
### Distinct Lines


Consider all lattice points (a,b,c) with 0 \le a,b,c \le N.


From the origin O(0,0,0) all lines are drawn to the other lattice points.<br />
Let D(N) be the number of <i>distinct</i> such lines.


You are given that D(1 000 000) = 831909254469114121.

Find D(10^10). Give as your answer the first nine digits followed by the last nine digits.
