## 题目
### Minimum area of a convex grid polygon

A <i>symmetrical convex grid polygon</i> is a polygon such that:
<ul><li>All its vertices have integer coordinates.</li>
<li>All its internal angles are strictly smaller than $180°$.</li>
<li>It has both horizontal and vertical symmetry.</li>
</ul>For example, the left polygon is a convex grid polygon which has neither horizontal nor vertical symmetry, while the right one is a valid symmetrical convex grid polygon with six vertices:
<div style="text-align:center;">
<img src="project/images/p742_hexagons.jpg" class="dark_img" alt="" /></div>

Define $A(N)$, the minimum area of a symmetrical convex grid polygon with $N$ vertices.

You are given $A(4) = 1$, $A(8) = 7$, $A(40) = 1039$ and $A(100) = 17473$.

Find $A(1000)$.
