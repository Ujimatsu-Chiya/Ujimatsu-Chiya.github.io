## 题目
### Cutting Squares


A square piece of paper with integer dimensions N\timesN is placed with a corner at the origin and two of its sides along the <var>x</var>- and <var>y</var>-axes. Then, we cut it up respecting the following rules:
<ul><li>We only make straight cuts between two points lying on different sides of the square, and having integer coordinates.</li>
<li>Two cuts cannot cross, but several cuts can meet at the same border point.</li>
<li>Proceed until no more legal cuts can be made.</li>
</ul>Counting any reflections or rotations as distinct, we call C(N) the number of ways to cut an N\timesN square. For example, C(1) = 2 and C(2) = 30 (shown below).

What is C(30) mod 10^8 ?

### Cutting Squares

A square piece of paper with integer dimensions N\timesN is placed with a corner at the origin and two of its sides along the x- and y-axes. Then, we cut it up respecting the following rules:
<ul>
<li>We only make straight cuts between two points lying on different sides of the square, and having integer coordinates.</li>
<li>Two cuts cannot cross, but several cuts can meet at the same border point.</li>
<li>Proceed until no more legal cuts can be made.</li>
</ul>
Counting any reflections or rotations as distinct, we call C(N) the number of ways to cut an N\timesN square. For example, C(1)&thinsp;=&thinsp;2 and C(2)&thinsp;=&thinsp;30 (shown below).
