## 题目
### Polynomials with at least one integer root

A root or zero of a polynomial P(<var>x</var>) is a solution to the equation P(<var>x</var>) = 0. <br />
Define P_<var>n</var> as the polynomial whose coefficients are the digits of <var>n</var>.<br />
For example, P_5703(<var>x</var>) = 5<var>x</var>^3 + 7<var>x</var>^2 + 3.

We can see that:<ul><li>P_<var>n</var>(0) is the last digit of <var>n</var>,</li>
<li>P_<var>n</var>(1) is the sum of the digits of <var>n</var>,</li>
<li>P_<var>n</var>(10) is <var>n</var> itself.</li></ul>Define Z(<var>k</var>) as the number of positive integers, <var>n</var>, not exceeding <var>k</var> for which the polynomial P_<var>n</var> has at least one integer root.

It can be verified that Z(100 000) is 14696.

What is Z(10^16)?

<li>P_n(10) is n itself.</li>
</ul>
Define Z(k) as the number of positive integers, n, not exceeding k for which the polynomial P_n has at least one integer root.
It can be verified that Z(100 000) is 14696.
What is Z(10^16)?
