### 123 Numbers


We define <i>123-numbers</i> as follows:


<ul><li>1 is the smallest 123-number.</li>
<li>When written in base 10 the only digits that can be present are "1", "2" and "3" and if present the number of times they each occur is also a 123-number.</li>
</ul>
So 2 is a 123-number, since it consists of one  digit "2" and 1 is a 123-number. Therefore, 33 is a 123-number as well since it consists of two digits "3" and 2 is a 123-number.<br />
On the other hand, 1111 is not a 123-number, since it contains 4 digits "1" and 4 is not a 123-number.


In ascending order, the first 123-numbers are:<br />
$1, 2, 3, 11, 12, 13, 21, 22, 23, 31, 32, 33, 111, 112, 113, 121, 122, 123, 131, \ldots$


Let $F(n)$ be the $n$-th 123-number. For example $F(4)=11$, $F(10)=31$, $F(40)=1112$, $F(1000)=1223321$ and $F(6000)= 2333333333323$.


Find $F(111\,111\,111\,111\,222\,333)$. Give your answer modulo $123\,123\,123$.

### $123$-Numbers

We define <i>$123$-numbers</i> as follows:
<ul>
<li>$1$ is the smallest $123$-number.</li>
<li>When written in base $10$ the only digits that can be present are “$1$”, “$2$” and “$3$” and if present the number of times they each occur is also a $123$-number.</li>
</ul>
So $2$ is a $123$-number, since it consists of one digit “$2$” and $1$ is a $123$-number. Therefore, $33$ is a $123$-number as well since it consists of two digits “$3$” and $2$ is a $123$-number.<br>On the other hand, $1111$ is not a $123$-number, since it contains $4$ digits “$1$” and $4$ is not a $123$-number.
In ascending order, the first $123$-numbers are:<br>$1, 2, 3, 11, 12, 13, 21, 22, 23, 31, 32, 33, 111, 112, 113, 121, 122, 123, 131, \ldots$
Let $F(n)$ be the $n$-th $123$-number. For example $F(4)=11$, $F(10)=31$, $F(40)=1112$, $F(1000)=1223321$ and $F(6000)= 2333333333323$.
Find $F(111\ 111\ 111\ 111\ 222\ 333)$. Give your answer modulo $123\ 123\ 123$.
