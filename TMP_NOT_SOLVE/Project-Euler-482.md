## 题目
### The incenter of a triangle


ABC is an integer sided triangle with incenter I and perimeter p.<br />
The segments IA, IB and IC have integral length as well. 


Let L = p + |IA| + |IB| + |IC|. 


Let S(P) = <span style="font-size:larger;"><span style="font-size:larger;">\sum</span></span> L for all such triangles where p \le P. For example, S(10^3) = 3619.


Find S(10^7).
