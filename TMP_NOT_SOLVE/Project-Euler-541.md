### Divisibility of Harmonic Number Denominators

The <var>n</var>^th<b>harmonic number</b> <var>H_n</var> is defined as the sum of the multiplicative inverses of the first <var>n</var> positive integers, and can be written as a <b>reduced fraction</b> <var>a_n/b_n</var>.<br />
$H_n = \displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^n \frac 1 k = \frac {a_n} {b_n}$, with $\text {gcd}(a_n, b_n)=1$.

Let <var>M</var>(<var>p</var>) be the largest value of <var>n</var> such that <var>b_n</var> is not divisible by <var>p</var>.

For example, <var>M</var>(3) = 68 because $H_{68} = \frac {a_{68}} {b_{68}} = \frac {14094018321907827923954201611} {2933773379069966367528193600}$, <var>b</var>_68=2933773379069966367528193600 is not divisible by 3, but all larger harmonic numbers have denominators divisible by 3.

You are given <var>M</var>(7) = 719102.

Find <var>M</var>(137).

### Divisibility of Harmonic Number Denominators

The n^th<b>harmonic number</b> H_n is defined as the sum of the multiplicative inverses of the first n positive integers, and can be written as a <b>reduced fraction</b> a_n/b_n.<br>$H_n = \displaystyle \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{k} = \frac {a_n} {b_n}$, with$\text {gcd}(a_n, b_n)=1$.
Let M(p) be the largest value of n such that b_n is not divisible by p.
For example, M(3) = 68 because H_{68} = \frac {a_{68}} {b_{68}} = \frac {14094018321907827923954201611} {2933773379069966367528193600},<br>b_68=2933773379069966367528193600 is not divisible by 3, but all larger harmonic numbers have denominators divisible by 3.
You are given M(7) = 719102.
Find M(137).
