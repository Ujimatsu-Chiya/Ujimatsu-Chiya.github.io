### Binary Quadratic Form II

Consider the following binary quadratic form:
$$
\begin{align}
f(x,y)=x^2+5xy+3y^2
\end{align}
$$
A positive integer $q$ has a primitive representation if there exist positive integers $x$ and $y$ such that $q = f(x,y)$ and <span style="white-space:nowrap;">$\gcd(x,y)=1$.</span>

We are interested in primitive representations of perfect squares. For example:<br />
$17^2=f(1,9)$<br />
$87^2=f(13,40) = f(46,19)$

Define $C(N)$ as the total number of primitive representations of $z^2$ for $0 < z \leq N$.<br /> 
Multiple representations are counted separately, so for example $z=87$ is counted twice.

You are given $C(10^3)=142$ and $C(10^{6})=142463$ 

Find $C(10^{14})$.
