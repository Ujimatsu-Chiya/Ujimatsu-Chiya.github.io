## 题目
### Lattice Quadrilaterals


A <b>simple quadrilateral</b> is a polygon that has four distinct vertices, has no straight angles and does not self-intersect.

Let Q(m, n) be the number of simple quadrilaterals whose vertices are lattice points with coordinates (x,y) satisfying 0 \le x \le m and 0 \le y \le n.

For example, Q(2, 2) = 94 as can be seen below:

It can also be verified that Q(3, 7) = 39590, Q(12, 3) = 309000 and Q(123, 45) = 70542215894646.

Find Q(12345, 6789) mod 135707531.
