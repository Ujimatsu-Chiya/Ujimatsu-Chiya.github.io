## 题目
### Titanic sets


A set of lattice points S is called a <i>titanic set</i> if there exists a line passing through exactly two points in S.

An example of a titanic set is S = {(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1), (2, 0), (1, 0)}, where the line passing through (0, 1) and (2, 0) does not pass through any other point in S.

On the other hand, the set {(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4)} is not a titanic set since the line passing through any two points in the set also passes through the other two.

For any positive integer <var>N</var>, let <var>T</var>(<var>N</var>) be the number of titanic sets S whose every point (<var>x</var>, <var>y</var>) satisfies 0 \le <var>x</var>, <var>y</var> \le <var>N</var>.
It can be verified that <var>T</var>(1) = 11, <var>T</var>(2) = 494, <var>T</var>(4) = 33554178, <var>T</var>(111) mod 10^8 = 13500401 and <var>T</var>(10^5) mod 10^8 = 63259062.

Find <var>T</var>(10^11) mod 10^8.
