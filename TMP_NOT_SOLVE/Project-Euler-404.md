### Crisscross Ellipses



E_<var>a</var> is an ellipse with an equation of the form x^2 + 4y^2 = 4<var>a</var>^2.<br />
E_<var>a</var>' is the rotated image of E_<var>a</var> by θ degrees counterclockwise around the origin O(0, 0) for 0° < θ < 90°.

<var>b</var> is the distance to the origin of the two intersection points closest to the origin and <var>c</var> is the distance of the two other intersection points.<br />
We call an ordered triplet (<var>a</var>, <var>b</var>, <var>c</var>) a <i>canonical ellipsoidal triplet</i> if <var>a</var>, <var>b</var> and <var>c</var> are positive integers.<br />
For example, (209, 247, 286) is a canonical ellipsoidal triplet.



Let C(<var>N</var>) be the number of distinct canonical ellipsoidal triplets (<var>a</var>, <var>b</var>, <var>c</var>) for <var>a</var> \le <var>N</var>.<br />
It can be verified that C(10^3) = 7, C(10^4) = 106 and C(10^6) = 11845.



Find C(10^17).
