### Tricoloured Coin Fountains


An arrangement of coins in one or more rows with the bottom row being a block without gaps and every coin in a higher row touching exactly two coins in the row below is called a <b>fountain</b> of coins. Let <var>f</var>(<var>n</var>) be the number of possible fountains with <var>n</var> coins. For 4 coins there are three possible arrangements:
<div align="center"><img src="project/images/p519_coin_fountain.png" alt="p519_coin_fountain.png" /></div>
Therefore <var>f</var>(4) = 3 while <var>f</var>(10) = 78.
Let <var>T</var>(<var>n</var>) be the number of all possible colourings with three colours for all <var>f</var>(<var>n</var>) different fountains with <var>n</var> coins, given the condition that no two touching coins have the same colour. Below you see the possible colourings for one of the three valid fountains for 4 coins:
<div align="center"><img src="project/images/p519_tricolored_coin_fountain.png" alt="p519_tricolored_coin_fountain.png" /></div>
You are given that <var>T</var>(4) = 48 and <var>T</var>(10) = 17760.
Find the last 9 digits of <var>T</var>(20000).

### Tricolored Coin Fountains

An arrangement of coins in one or more rows with the bottom row being a block without gaps and every coin in a higher row touching exactly two coins in the row below is called a **fountain** of coins. Let f(n) be the number of possible fountains with n coins. For 4 coins there are three possible arrangements:

Therefore f(4)&nbsp;=&nbsp;3 while f(10)&nbsp;=&nbsp;78.
Let T(n) be the number of all possible colorings with three colors for all f(n) different fountains with n coins, given the condition that no two touching coins have the same color. Below you see the possible colorings for one of the three valid fountains for 4 coins:
<center><img src="https://projecteuler.net/project/images/p519_tricolored_coin_fountain.png"></center>

You are given that T(4)&nbsp;=&nbsp;48 and T(10)&nbsp;=&nbsp;17760.
Find the last 9 digits of T(20000).
