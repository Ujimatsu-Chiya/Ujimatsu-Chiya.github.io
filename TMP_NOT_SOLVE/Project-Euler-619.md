## 题目
### Square subsets


For a set of positive integers $\{a, a+1, a+2, \dots , b\}$, let $C(a,b)$ be the number of non-empty subsets in which the product of all elements is a perfect square.
For example $C(5,10)=3$, since the products of all elements of $\{5, 8, 10\}$, $\{5, 8, 9, 10\}$ and $\{9\}$ are perfect squares, and no other subsets of $\{5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}$ have this property.
You are given that $C(40,55) =15$, and $C(1000,1234) \text{ mod } 1000000007=975523611$.

Find $C(1000000,1234567) \text{ mod } 1000000007$.

### Square subsets

For a set of positive integers ${a,a+1,a+2,\ldots,b}$, let $C(a,b)$ be the number of non-empty subsets in which the product of all elements is a perfect square.
For example $C(5,10)=3$, since the products of all elements of ${5,8,10}$, ${5,8,9,10}$ and ${9}$ are perfect squares, and no other subsets of ${5,6,7,8,9,10}$ have this property.
You are given that $C(40,55)=15$, and $C(1000,1234)\text{ mod }1000000007=975523611$.
Find $C(1000000,1234567)\text{ mod }1000000007$.
