# Project Euler 701
## 题目
### Random connected area



Consider a rectangle made up of $W \times H$ square cells each with area 1.<br /> Each cell is independently coloured black with probability 0.5 otherwise white. Black cells sharing an edge are assumed to be connected.<br />Consider the maximum area of connected cells.


Define $E(W,H)$ to be the expected value of this maximum area.
For example, $E(2,2)=1.875$, as illustrated below.

<div class="center">
<img src="project/images/p701_randcon.png" alt="3 random connected area" /></div>

You are also given $E(4, 4) = 5.76487732$, rounded to 8 decimal places.


Find $E(7, 7)$, rounded to 8 decimal places.
