### Prime-Sum Numbers


Define function P(<var>n</var>,<var>k</var>) = 1 if <var>n</var> can be written as the sum of <var>k</var> prime numbers (with repetitions allowed), and P(<var>n</var>,<var>k</var>) = 0 otherwise.

For example, P(10,2) = 1 because 10 can be written as either 3 + 7 or 5 + 5, but P(11,2) = 0 because no two primes can sum to 11.

Let S(<var>n</var>) be the sum of all P(<var>i</var>,<var>k</var>) over 1 \le <var>i</var>,<var>k</var> \le <var>n</var>.

For example, S(10) = 20, S(100) = 2402, and S(1000) = 248838.

Let F(<var>k</var>) be the <var>k</var>th Fibonacci number (with F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1).

Find the sum of all S(F(<var>k</var>)) over 3 \le <var>k</var> \le 44

### Prime-Sum Numbers

Define function P(n,k) = 1 if n can be written as the sum of k prime numbers (with repetitions allowed), and P(n,k) = 0 otherwise.
For example, P(10,2) = 1 because 10 can be written as either 3 + 7 or 5 + 5, but P(11,2) = 0 because no two primes can sum to 11.
Let S(n) be the sum of all P(i,k) over 1 \le i,k \le n.
For example, S(10) = 20, S(100) = 2402, and S(1000) = 248838.
Let F(k) be the k^th Fibonacci number (with F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1).
Find the sum of all S(F(k)) over 3 \le k \le 44
