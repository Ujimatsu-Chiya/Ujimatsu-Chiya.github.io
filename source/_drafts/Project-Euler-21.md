### Amicable numbers
Let $d(n)$ be defined as the sum of proper divisors of $n$ (numbers less than $n$ which divide evenly into $n$).<br>If $d(a) = b$ and $d(b) = a$, where $a \neq b$, then $a$ and $b$ are an amicable pair and each of $a$ and $b$ are called amicable numbers.
For example, the proper divisors of $220$ are $1$, $2$, $4$, $5$, $10$, $11$, $20$, $22$, $44$, $55$ and $110$; therefore $d(220) = 284$. The proper divisors of $284$ are $1$, $2$, $4$, $71$ and $142$; so $d(284) = 220$.
Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under $10000$.
