### Names score
Using <a href="https://projecteuler.net/project/resources/p022_names.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">names.txt</a>(right click and ‘Save Link/Target As…’), a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.
For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth $3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53$, is the $938$th name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of $938 \times 53 = 49714$.
What is the total of all the name scores in the file?

### Non-abundant sums
A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is exactly equal to the number. For example, the sum of the proper divisors of $28$ would be $1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28$, which means that $28$ is a perfect number.
A number $n$ is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less than $n$ and it is called abundant if this sum exceeds $n$.
As $12$ is the smallest abundant number, $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16$, the smallest number that can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers is $24$. By mathematical analysis, it can be shown that all integers greater than $28123$ can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers. However, this upper limit cannot be reduced any further by analysis even though it is known that the greatest number that cannot be expressed as the sum of two abundant numbers is less than this limit.
Find the sum of all the positive integers which cannot be written as the sum of two abundant numbers.

### Lexicographic permutations
A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. For example, $3124$ is one possible permutation of the digits $1$, $2$, $3$ and $4$. If all of the permutations are listed numerically or alphabetically, we call it lexicographic order. The lexicographic permutations of $0$, $1$ and $2$ are:
$$012 \quad 021 \quad 102 \quad 120 \quad 201 \quad 210$$
What is the millionth lexicographic permutation of the digits $0$, $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, $6$, $7$, $8$ and $9$?

### $1000$-digit Fibonacci number
The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:<br>$$F_1 = 1\quad F_2= 1$$<br>$$F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$$
Hence the first 12 terms will be:<br>$$\begin{aligned}<br>F_1&amp;=1\\<br>F_2&amp;=1\\<br>F_3&amp;=2\\<br>F_4&amp;=3\\<br>F_5&amp;=5\\<br>F_6&amp;=8\\<br>F_7&amp;=13\\<br>F_8&amp;=21\\<br>F_9&amp;=34\\<br>F_{10}&amp;=55\\<br>F_{11}&amp;=89\\<br>F_{12}&amp;=144\\<br>\end{aligned}$$
The $12$th term, $F_{12}$, is the first term to contain three digits.

### Reciprocal cycles
A unit fraction contains $1$ in the numerator. The decimal representation of the unit fractions with denominators $2$ to $10$ are given:
$$\begin{aligned}<br>\frac 1 2 &amp;= 0.5\\<br>\frac 1 3 &amp;= 0.(3)\\<br>\frac 1 4 &amp;= 0.25\\<br>\frac 1 5 &amp;= 0.2\\<br>\frac 1 6 &amp;= 0.1(6)\\<br>\frac 1 7 &amp;= 0.(142857)\\<br>\frac 1 8 &amp;= 0.125\\<br>\frac 1 9 &amp;= 0.(1)\\<br>\frac 1 {10} &amp;= 0.1\\<br>\end{aligned}$$
Where $0.1(6)$ means $0.166666\ldots$, and has a $1$-digit recurring cycle. It can be seen that $\frac{1}{7}$ has a $6$-digit recurring cycle.
Find the value of $d&lt;1000$ for which $\frac{1}{d}$ contains the longest recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part.

### Quadratic primes
Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:
$$n^2 + n + 41$$
It turns out that the formula will produce $40$ primes for the consecutive integer values $0 \le n \le 39$. However, when $n = 40$, $40^2 + 40 + 41 = 40(40 + 1) + 41$ is divisible by $41$, and certainly when $n = 41$, $41^2 + 41 + 41$ is clearly divisible by $41$.
The incredible formula $n^2 - 79n + 1601$ was discovered, which produces $80$ primes for the consecutive values $0 \le n \le 79$. The product of the coefficients, $−79$ and $1601$, is $−126479$.
Considering quadratics of the form:<br>$n^2 + an + b$, where $|a|&lt;1000$ and $|b| \le 1000$;<br>where $|n|$ is the modulus/absolute value of $n$, e.g. $|11| = 11$ and $|-4| = 4$.
Find the product of the coefficients, $a$ and $b$, for the quadratic expression that produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive values of $n$, starting with $n = 0$.

### Distinct powers
Consider all integer combinations of $a^b$ for $2 \le a \le 5$ and $2 \le b \le 5$:

If they are then placed in numerical order, with any repeats removed, we get the following sequence of $15$ distinct terms:
$$4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 64, 81, 125, 243, 256, 625, 1024, 3125$$

### Digit cancelling fractions
The fraction <sup>49</sup>/<sub>98</sub> is a curious fraction, as an inexperienced mathematician in attempting to simplify it may incorrectly believe that <sup>49</sup>/<sub>98</sub> = <sup>4</sup>/<sub>8</sub>, which is correct, is obtained by cancelling the 9s.
We shall consider fractions like, <sup>30</sup>/<sub>50</sub> = <sup>3</sup>/<sub>5</sub>, to be trivial examples.
There are exactly four non-trivial examples of this type of fraction, less than one in value, and containing two digits in the numerator and denominator.
If the product of these four fractions is given in its lowest common terms, find the value of the denominator.

<blockquote>
192 × 1 = 192<br>192 × 2 = 384<br>192 × 3 = 576
</blockquote>
By concatenating each product we get the 1 to 9 pandigital, 192384576. We will call 192384576 the concatenated product of 192 and (1,2,3)
The same can be achieved by starting with 9 and multiplying by 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, giving the pandigital, 918273645, which is the concatenated product of 9 and (1,2,3,4,5).

### Sub-string divisibility
The number, 1406357289, is a 0 to 9 pandigital number because it is made up of each of the digits 0 to 9 in some order, but it also has a rather interesting sub-string divisibility property.

### Poker hands
In the card game poker, a hand consists of five cards and are ranked, from lowest to highest, in the following way:
<ul>
<li><strong>High Card</strong>: Highest value card.</li>
<li><strong>One Pair</strong>: Two cards of the same value.</li>
<li><strong>Two Pairs</strong>: Two different pairs.</li>
<li><strong>Three of a Kind</strong>: Three cards of the same value.</li>
<li><strong>Straight</strong>: All cards are consecutive values.</li>
<li><strong>Flush</strong>: All cards of the same suit.</li>
<li><strong>Full House</strong>: Three of a kind and a pair.</li>
<li><strong>Four of a Kind</strong>: Four cards of the same value.</li>
<li><strong>Straight Flush</strong>: All cards are consecutive values of same suit.</li>
<li><strong>Royal Flush</strong>: Ten, Jack, Queen, King, Ace, in same suit.</li>
</ul>
The cards are valued in the order:2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace.
If two players have the same ranked hands then the rank made up of the highest value wins; for example, a pair of eights beats a pair of fives (see example 1 below). But if two ranks tie, for example, both players have a pair of queens, then highest cards in each hand are compared (see example 4 below); if the highest cards tie then the next highest cards are compared, and so on.
Consider the following five hands dealt to two players:

Not all numbers produce palindromes so quickly. For example,
349 + 943 = 1292<br>1292 + 2921 = 4213<br>4213 + 3124 = 7337
That is, 349 took three iterations to arrive at a palindrome.
Although no one has proved it yet, it is thought that some numbers, like 196, never produce a palindrome. A number that never forms a palindrome through the reverse and add process is called a Lychrel number. Due to the theoretical nature of these numbers, and for the purpose of this problem, we shall assume that a number is Lychrel until proven otherwise. In addition you are given that for every number below ten-thousand, it will either (i) become a palindrome in less than fifty iterations, or, (ii) no one, with all the computing power that exists, has managed so far to map it to a palindrome. In fact, 10677 is the first number to be shown to require over fifty iterations before producing a palindrome:<br>4668731596684224866951378664 (53 iterations, 28-digits).
Surprisingly, there are palindromic numbers that are themselves Lychrel numbers; the first example is 4994.
How many Lychrel numbers are there below ten-thousand?
NOTE: Wording was modified slightly on 24 April 2007 to emphasise the theoretical nature of Lychrel numbers.

### Powerful Digit Sum
A googol (10<sup>100</sup>) is a massive number: one followed by one-hundred zeros; 100<sup>100</sup> is almost unimaginably large: one followed by two-hundred zeros. Despite their size, the sum of the digits in each number is only 1.

### Square root convergents
It is possible to show that the square root of two can be expressed as an infinite continued fraction.
<center>√ 2 = 1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + ... ))) = 1.414213...</center>

By expanding this for the first four iterations, we get:
1 + 1/2 = 3/2 = 1.5<br>1 + 1/(2 + 1/2) = 7/5 = 1.4<br>1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/2)) = 17/12 = 1.41666…<br>1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/2))) = 41/29 = 1.41379…
The next three expansions are 99/70, 239/169, and 577/408, but the eighth expansion, 1393/985, is the first example where the number of digits in the numerator exceeds the number of digits in the denominator.

### XOR decryption
Each character on a computer is assigned a unique code and the preferred standard is ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange). For example, uppercase A = 65, asterisk (*) = 42, and lowercase k = 107.
A modern encryption method is to take a text file, convert the bytes to ASCII, then XOR each byte with a given value, taken from a secret key. The advantage with the XOR function is that using the same encryption key on the cipher text, restores the plain text; for example, 65 XOR 42 = 107, then 107 XOR 42 = 65.
For unbreakable encryption, the key is the same length as the plain text message, and the key is made up of random bytes. The user would keep the encrypted message and the encryption key in different locations, and without both “halves”, it is impossible to decrypt the message.
Unfortunately, this method is impractical for most users, so the modified method is to use a password as a key. If the password is shorter than the message, which is likely, the key is repeated cyclically throughout the message. The balance for this method is using a sufficiently long password key for security, but short enough to be memorable.
Your task has been made easy, as the encryption key consists of three lower case characters. Using <a href="https://projecteuler.net/project/resources/p059_cipher.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cipher.txt</a> (right click and ‘Save Link/Target As…’), a file containing the encrypted ASCII codes, and the knowledge that the plain text must contain common English words, decrypt the message and find the sum of the ASCII values in the original text.

### Odd period square roots
All square roots are periodic when written as continued fractions and can be written in the form:
$$\sqrt{N}=a_0+\frac{1}{a_1+\frac{1}{a_2+\frac{1}{a_3+…}}}$$
For example, let us consider √23:
$$\sqrt{23}=4+\sqrt{23}-4=4+\frac{1}{\frac{1}{\sqrt{23}-4}}=4+\frac{1}{1+\frac{\sqrt{23}-3}{7}}$$
If we continue we would get the following expansion:
$$\sqrt{N}=4+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{3+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{8+…}}}}$$
The process can be summarised as follows:
$$a_0=4 \text{, } \frac{1}{\sqrt{23}-4}=\frac{\sqrt{23}+4}{7}=1+\frac{\sqrt{23}-3}{7}$$<br>$$a_1=1 \text{, } \frac{7}{\sqrt{23}-3}=\frac{7(\sqrt{23}+3)}{14}=3+\frac{\sqrt{23}-3}{2}$$<br>$$a_2=3 \text{, } \frac{2}{\sqrt{23}-3}=\frac{2(\sqrt{23}+3)}{14}=1+\frac{\sqrt{23}-4}{7}$$<br>$$a_3=1 \text{, } \frac{7}{\sqrt{23}-4}=\frac{7(\sqrt{23}+4)}{7}=8+\sqrt{23}-4$$<br>$$a_4=8 \text{, } \frac{1}{\sqrt{23}-4}=\frac{\sqrt{23}+4}{7}=1+\frac{\sqrt{23}-3}{7}$$<br>$$a_5=1 \text{, } \frac{7}{\sqrt{23}-3}=\frac{7(\sqrt{23}+3)}{14}=3+\frac{\sqrt{23}-3}{2}$$<br>$$a_6=3 \text{, } \frac{2}{\sqrt{23}-3}=\frac{2(\sqrt{23}+3)}{14}=1+\frac{\sqrt{23}-4}{7}$$<br>$$a_7=1 \text{, } \frac{7}{\sqrt{23}-4}=\frac{7(\sqrt{23}+4)}{7}=8+\sqrt{23}-4$$
It can be seen that the sequence is repeating. For conciseness, we use the notation √23 = [4;(1,3,1,8)], to indicate that the block (1,3,1,8) repeats indefinitely.
The first ten continued fraction representations of (irrational) square roots are:
√2=[1;(2)], period=1<br>√3=[1;(1,2)], period=2<br>√5=[2;(4)], period=1<br>√6=[2;(2,4)], period=2<br>√7=[2;(1,1,1,4)], period=4<br>√8=[2;(1,4)], period=2<br>√10=[3;(6)], period=1<br>√11=[3;(3,6)], period=2<br>√12= [3;(2,6)], period=2<br>√13=[3;(1,1,1,1,6)], period=5

### Convergents of e
The square root of 2 can be written as an infinite continued fraction.
$$\sqrt{2}=1+\frac{1}{2+\frac{1}{2+\frac{1}{2+\frac{1}{2+…}}}}$$
The infinite continued fraction can be written, √2 = [1;(2)], (2) indicates that 2 repeats <i>ad infinitum</i>. In a similar way, √23 = [4;(1,3,1,8)].
It turns out that the sequence of partial values of continued fractions for square roots provide the best rational approximations. Let us consider the convergents for √2.
$$1+\frac{1}{2}=\frac{3}{2}$$<br>$$1+\frac{1}{2+\frac{1}{2}}=\frac{7}{5}$$<br>$$1+\frac{1}{2+\frac{1}{2+\frac{1}{2}}}=\frac{17}{12}$$<br>$$1+\frac{1}{2+\frac{1}{2+\frac{1}{2+\frac{1}{2}}}}=\frac{41}{29}$$
Hence the sequence of the first ten convergents for √2 are:
1, 3/2, 7/5, 17/12, 41/29, 99/70, 239/169, 577/408, 1393/985, 3363/2378, …
What is most surprising is that the important mathematical constant,<br>e = [2; 1,2,1, 1,4,1, 1,6,1 , … , 1,2k,1, …].
The first ten terms in the sequence of convergents for e are:
2, 3, 8/3, 11/4, 19/7, 87/32, 106/39, 193/71, 1264/465, 1457/536, …
The sum of digits in the numerator of the 10<sup>th</sup> convergent is 1+4+5+7=17.
Find the sum of digits in the numerator of the 100<sup>th</sup> convergent of the continued fraction for e.

### Digit factorial chains
The number 145 is well known for the property that the sum of the factorial of its digits is equal to 145:
1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145
Perhaps less well known is 169, in that it produces the longest chain of numbers that link back to 169; it turns out that there are only three such loops that exist:
169 → 363601 → 1454 → 169<br>871 → 45361 → 871<br>872 → 45362 → 872
It is not difficult to prove that EVERY starting number will eventually get stuck in a loop. For example,
69 → 363600 → 1454 → 169 → 363601 (→ 1454)<br>78 → 45360 → 871 → 45361 (→ 871)<br>540 → 145 (→ 145)
Starting with 69 produces a chain of five non-repeating terms, but the longest non-repeating chain with a starting number below one million is sixty terms.

### Coin partitions
Let p(n) represent the number of different ways in which n coins can be separated into piles. For example, five coins can separated into piles in exactly seven different ways, so p(5)=7.
OOOOO<br>OOOO O<br>OOO OO<br>OOO O O<br>OO OO O<br>OO O O O<br>O O O O O
Find the least value of n for which p(n) is divisible by one million.

### Passcode derivation
A common security method used for online banking is to ask the user for three random characters from a passcode. For example, if the passcode was 531278, they may ask for the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th characters; the expected reply would be: 317.
The text file, <a href="https://projecteuler.net/project/resources/p079_keylog.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keylog.txt</a>, contains fifty successful login attempts.
Given that the three characters are always asked for in order, analyse the file so as to determine the shortest possible secret passcode of unknown length.

### Square root digital expansion
It is well known that if the square root of a natural number is not an integer, then it is irrational. The decimal expansion of such square roots is infinite without any repeating pattern at all.
The square root of two is $1.41421356237309504880\ldots$, and the digital sum of the first one hundred decimal digits is $475$.
For the first one hundred natural numbers, find the total of the digital sums of the first one hundred decimal digits for all the irrational square roots.

A player starts on the GO square and adds the scores on two 6-sided dice to determine the number of squares they advance in a clockwise direction. Without any further rules we would expect to visit each square with equal probability: 2.5%. However, landing on G2J (Go To Jail), CC (community chest), and CH (chance) changes this distribution.
In addition to G2J, and one card from each of CC and CH, that orders the player to go directly to jail, if a player rolls three consecutive doubles, they do not advance the result of their 3rd roll. Instead they proceed directly to jail.
At the beginning of the game, the CC and CH cards are shuffled. When a player lands on CC or CH they take a card from the top of the respective pile and, after following the instructions, it is returned to the bottom of the pile. There are sixteen cards in each pile, but for the purpose of this problem we are only concerned with cards that order a movement; any instruction not concerned with movement will be ignored and the player will remain on the CC/CH square.
<ul>
<li>Community Chest (2/16 cards):<ol>
<li>Advance to GO</li>
<li>Go to JAIL</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Chance (10/16 cards)<ol>
<li>Advance to GO</li>
<li>Go to JAIL</li>
<li>Go to C1</li>
<li>Go to E3</li>
<li>Go to H2</li>
<li>Go to R1</li>
<li>Go to next R (railway company)</li>
<li>Go to next R</li>
<li>Go to next U (utility company)</li>
<li>Go back 3 squares</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
The heart of this problem concerns the likelihood of visiting a particular square. That is, the probability of finishing at that square after a roll. For this reason it should be clear that, with the exception of G2J for which the probability of finishing on it is zero, the CH squares will have the lowest probabilities, as 5/8 request a movement to another square, and it is the final square that the player finishes at on each roll that we are interested in. We shall make no distinction between “Just Visiting” and being sent to JAIL, and we shall also ignore the rule about requiring a double to “get out of jail”, assuming that they pay to get out on their next turn.
By starting at GO and numbering the squares sequentially from 00 to 39 we can concatenate these two-digit numbers to produce strings that correspond with sets of squares.
Statistically it can be shown that the three most popular squares, in order, are JAIL (6.24%) = Square 10, E3 (3.18%) = Square 24, and GO (3.09%) = Square 00. So these three most popular squares can be listed with the six-digit modal string: 102400.
If, instead of using two 6-sided dice, two 4-sided dice are used, find the six-digit modal string.

### Cuboid route
A spider, S, sits in one corner of a cuboid room, measuring 6 by 5 by 3, and a fly, F, sits in the opposite corner. By travelling on the surfaces of the room the shortest “straight line” distance from S to F is 10 and the path is shown on the diagram.
<center><img src="https://projecteuler.net/project/images/p086.gif" alt=""></center>

However, there are up to three “shortest” path candidates for any given cuboid and the shortest route doesn’t always have integer length.
It can be shown that there are exactly 2060 distinct cuboids, ignoring rotations, with integer dimensions, up to a maximum size of M by M by M, for which the shortest route has integer length when M = 100. This is the least value of M for which the number of solutions first exceeds two thousand; the number of solutions when M = 99 is 1975.
Find the least value of M such that the number of solutions first exceeds one million.

### Product-sum numbers
A natural number, N, that can be written as the sum and product of a given set of at least two natural numbers, {a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, … , a<sub>k</sub>} is called a product-sum number: N = a<sub>1</sub> + a<sub>2</sub> + … + a<sub>k</sub> = a<sub>1</sub> × a<sub>2</sub> × … × a<sub>k</sub>.
For example, 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 1 × 2 × 3.
For a given set of size, k, we shall call the smallest N with this property a minimal product-sum number. The minimal product-sum numbers for sets of size, k = 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are as follows.
k=2: 4 = 2 × 2 = 2 + 2<br>k=3: 6 = 1 × 2 × 3 = 1 + 2 + 3<br>k=4: 8 = 1 × 1 × 2 × 4 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4<br>k=5: 8 = 1 × 1 × 2 × 2 × 2  = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2<br>k=6: 12 = 1 × 1 × 1 × 1 × 2 × 6 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 6
Hence for 2≤k≤6, the sum of all the minimal product-sum numbers is 4+6+8+12 = 30; note that 8 is only counted once in the sum.
In fact, as the complete set of minimal product-sum numbers for 2≤k≤12 is {4, 6, 8, 12, 15, 16}, the sum is 61.
What is the sum of all the minimal product-sum numbers for 2≤k≤12000?

### Roman numerals
For a number written in Roman numerals to be considered valid there are basic rules which must be followed. Even though the rules allow some numbers to be expressed in more than one way there is always a “best” way of writing a particular number.
For example, it would appear that there are at least six ways of writing the number sixteen:
<span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">IIIIIIIIIIIIIIII</span><br><span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">VIIIIIIIIIII</span><br><span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">VVIIIIII</span><br><span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">XIIIIII</span><br><span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">VVVI</span><br><span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">XVI</span>
However, according to the rules only <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">XIIIIII</span> and <span style="font-family:courier new,monospace;">XVI</span> are valid, and the last example is considered to be the most efficient, as it uses the least number of numerals.
The 11K text file, <a href="https://projecteuler.net/project/resources/p089_roman.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">roman.txt</a> (right click and ‘Save Link/Target As…’), contains one thousand numbers written in valid, but not necessarily minimal, Roman numerals; see <a href="https://projecteuler.net/about=roman_numerals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">About… Roman Numerals</a> for the definitive rules for this problem.
Find the number of characters saved by writing each of these in their minimal form.
Note: You can assume that all the Roman numerals in the file contain no more than four consecutive identical units.

### Cube digit pairs
Each of the six faces on a cube has a different digit (0 to 9) written on it; the same is done to a second cube. By placing the two cubes side-by-side in different positions we can form a variety of 2-digit numbers.
For example, the square number 64 could be formed:
<center><img src="https://projecteuler.net/project/images/p090.gif" alt=""></center>

In fact, by carefully choosing the digits on both cubes it is possible to display all of the square numbers below one-hundred: 01, 04, 09, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, and 81.
For example, one way this can be achieved is by placing {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} on one cube and {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9} on the other cube.
However, for this problem we shall allow the 6 or 9 to be turned upside-down so that an arrangement like {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} and {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7} allows for all nine square numbers to be displayed; otherwise it would be impossible to obtain 09.
In determining a distinct arrangement we are interested in the digits on each cube, not the order.
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is equivalent to {3, 6, 4, 1, 2, 5}<br>{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is distinct from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9}
But because we are allowing 6 and 9 to be reversed, the two distinct sets in the last example both represent the extended set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9} for the purpose of forming 2-digit numbers.
How many distinct arrangements of the two cubes allow for all of the square numbers to be displayed?

### Square digit chains
A number chain is created by continuously adding the square of the digits in a number to form a new number until it has been seen before.
For example,
44 → 32 → 13 → 10 → <strong>1</strong> → <strong>1</strong><br>85 → <strong>89</strong> → 145 → 42 → 20 → 4 → 16 → 37 → 58 → <strong>89</strong>
Therefore any chain that arrives at 1 or 89 will become stuck in an endless loop. What is most amazing is that EVERY starting number will eventually arrive at 1 or 89.
How many starting numbers below ten million will arrive at 89?


# Project Euler 93
## 题目
### Arithmetic expressions
By using each of the digits from the set, {1, 2, 3, 4}, exactly once, and making use of the four arithmetic operations (+, −, *, /) and brackets/parentheses, it is possible to form different positive integer targets.
For example,
8 = (4 * (1 + 3)) / 2<br>14 = 4 * (3 + 1 / 2)<br>19 = 4 * (2 + 3) − 1<br>36 = 3 * 4 * (2 + 1)
Note that concatenations of the digits, like 12 + 34, are not allowed.
Using the set, {1, 2, 3, 4}, it is possible to obtain thirty-one different target numbers of which 36 is the maximum, and each of the numbers 1 to 28 can be obtained before encountering the first non-expressible number.
Find the set of four distinct digits, a &lt; b &lt; c &lt; d, for which the longest set of consecutive positive integers, 1 to n, can be obtained, giving your answer as a string: abcd.

### Almost equilateral triangles
It is easily proved that no equilateral triangle exists with integral length sides and integral area. However, the <i>almost equilateral triangle</i> 5-5-6 has an area of 12 square units.
We shall define an <i>almost equilateral triangle</i> to be a triangle for which two sides are equal and the third differs by no more than one unit.
Find the sum of the perimeters of all <i>almost equilateral triangles</i> with integral side lengths and area and whose perimeters do not exceed one billion (1,000,000,000).


# Project Euler 95
## 题目
### Amicable chains
The proper divisors of a number are all the divisors excluding the number itself. For example, the proper divisors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14. As the sum of these divisors is equal to 28, we call it a perfect number.
Interestingly the sum of the proper divisors of 220 is 284 and the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 220, forming a chain of two numbers. For this reason, 220 and 284 are called an amicable pair.
Perhaps less well known are longer chains. For example, starting with 12496, we form a chain of five numbers:
<center>12496 → 14288 → 15472 → 14536 → 14264 (→ 12496 → ...)</center>

Since this chain returns to its starting point, it is called an amicable chain.
Find the smallest member of the longest amicable chain with no element exceeding one million.

### Su Doku
Su Doku (Japanese meaning <i>number place</i>) is the name given to a popular puzzle concept. Its origin is unclear, but credit must be attributed to Leonhard Euler who invented a similar, and much more difficult, puzzle idea called Latin Squares. The objective of Su Doku puzzles, however, is to replace the blanks (or zeros) in a 9 by 9 grid in such that each row, column, and 3 by 3 box contains each of the digits 1 to 9. Below is an example of a typical starting puzzle grid and its solution grid.

A well constructed Su Doku puzzle has a unique solution and can be solved by logic, although it may be necessary to employ “guess and test” methods in order to eliminate options (there is much contested opinion over this). The complexity of the search determines the difficulty of the puzzle; the example above is considered <i>easy</i> because it can be solved by straight forward direct deduction.
The 6K text file, <a href="https://projecteuler.net/project/resources/p096_sudoku.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sudoku.txt</a>(right click and ‘Save Link/Target As…’), contains fifty different Su Doku puzzles ranging in difficulty, but all with unique solutions (the first puzzle in the file is the example above).
By solving all fifty puzzles find the sum of the 3-digit numbers found in the top left corner of each solution grid; for example, 483 is the 3-digit number found in the top left corner of the solution grid above.

### Large non-Mersenne prime
The first known prime found to exceed one million digits was discovered in 1999, and is a Mersenne prime of the form 2<sup>6972593</sup>−1; it contains exactly 2,098,960 digits. Subsequently other Mersenne primes, of the form 2<sup>p</sup>−1, have been found which contain more digits.
However, in 2004 there was found a massive non-Mersenne prime which contains 2,357,207 digits: 28433×2<sup>7830457</sup>+1.
Find the last ten digits of this prime number.

### Anagramic squares
By replacing each of the letters in the word CARE with 1, 2, 9, and 6 respectively, we form a square number: 1296 = 36<sup>2</sup>. What is remarkable is that, by using the same digital substitutions, the anagram, RACE, also forms a square number: 9216 = 96<sup>2</sup>. We shall call CARE (and RACE) a square anagram word pair and specify further that leading zeroes are not permitted, neither may a different letter have the same digital value as another letter.
Using <a href="https://projecteuler.net/project/resources/p098_words.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">words.txt</a> (right click and ‘Save Link/Target As…’), a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, find all the square anagram word pairs (a palindromic word is NOT considered to be an anagram of itself).
What is the largest square number formed by any member of such a pair?
NOTE: All anagrams formed must be contained in the given text file.

### Largest exponential
Comparing two numbers written in index form like 2<sup>11</sup> and 3<sup>7</sup> is not difficult, as any calculator would confirm that 2<sup>11</sup> = 2048 &lt; 3<sup>7</sup> = 2187.
However, confirming that 632382<sup>518061</sup> &gt; 519432<sup>525806</sup> would be much more difficult, as both numbers contain over three million digits.
Using <a href="https://projecteuler.net/project/resources/p099_base_exp.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">base_exp.txt</a>(right click and ‘Save Link/Target As…’), a 22K text file containing one thousand lines with a base/exponent pair on each line, determine which line number has the greatest numerical value.
NOTE: The first two lines in the file represent the numbers in the example given above.

### Arranged probability
If a box contains twenty-one coloured discs, composed of fifteen blue discs and six red discs, and two discs were taken at random, it can be seen that the probability of taking two blue discs, P(BB) = (15/21)×(14/20) = 1/2.
The next such arrangement, for which there is exactly 50% chance of taking two blue discs at random, is a box containing eighty-five blue discs and thirty-five red discs.
By finding the first arrangement to contain over 10<sup>12</sup> = 1,000,000,000,000 discs in total, determine the number of blue discs that the box would contain.
