### Reciprocal cycles
A unit fraction contains $1$ in the numerator. The decimal representation of the unit fractions with denominators $2$ to $10$ are given:

$$\begin{aligned}

\frac 1 2 &= 0.5\\\frac 1 3 &= 0.(3)\\\frac 1 4 &= 0.25\\\frac 1 5 &= 0.2\\\frac 1 6 &= 0.1(6)\\\frac 1 7 &= 0.(142857)\\\frac 1 8 &= 0.125\\\frac 1 9 &= 0.(1)\\\frac 1 {10} &= 0.1\\
\end{aligned}$$

Where $0.1(6)$ means $0.166666\ldots$, and has a $1$-digit recurring cycle. It can be seen that $\frac{1}{7}$ has a $6$-digit recurring cycle.

Find the value of $1000$ for which $\frac{1}{d}$ contains the longest recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part.
