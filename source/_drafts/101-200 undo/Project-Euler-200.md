## 题目
### Find the 200th prime-proof sqube containing the contiguous sub-string "200"

We shall define a sqube to be a number of the form, <var>p</var>^2<var>q</var>^3, where <var>p</var> and <var>q</var> are distinct primes.<br />
For example, 200 = 5^22^3 or 120072949 = 23^261^3.

The first five squbes are 72, 108, 200, 392, and 500.

Interestingly, 200 is also the first number for which you cannot change any single digit to make a prime; we shall call such numbers, prime-proof. The next prime-proof sqube which contains the contiguous sub-string "200" is 1992008.

Find the 200th prime-proof sqube containing the contiguous sub-string "200".
