## 题目
### Step Numbers

Consider the number 45656. <br />
It can be seen that each pair of consecutive digits of 45656 has a difference of one.<br />
A number for which every pair of consecutive digits has a difference of one is called a step number.<br />
A pandigital number  contains every decimal digit from 0 to 9 at least once.<br />

How many pandigital step numbers less than 10^40 are there?
