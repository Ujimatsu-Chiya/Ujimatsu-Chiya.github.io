## 题目
### Cuboid layers
The minimum number of cubes to cover every visible face on a cuboid measuring 3&nbsp;x&nbsp;2&nbsp;x&nbsp;1 is twenty-two.

If we then add a second layer to this solid it would require forty-six cubes to cover every visible face, the third layer would require seventy-eight cubes, and the fourth layer would require one-hundred and eighteen cubes to cover every visible face.
However, the first layer on a cuboid measuring 5&nbsp;x&nbsp;1&nbsp;x&nbsp;1 also requires twenty-two cubes; similarly the first layer on cuboids measuring 5&nbsp;x&nbsp;3&nbsp;x&nbsp;1, 7&nbsp;x&nbsp;2&nbsp;x&nbsp;1, and 11&nbsp;x&nbsp;1&nbsp;x&nbsp;1 all contain forty-six cubes.
We shall define C(n) to represent the number of cuboids that contain n cubes in one of its layers. So C(22) = 2, C(46) = 4, C(78) = 5, and C(118) = 8.
It turns out that 154 is the least value of n for which C(n) = 10.
Find the least value of n for which C(n) = 1000.
