# Project Euler 134
## 题目
### Prime pair connection


Consider the consecutive primes <i>p</i>_1 = 19 and <i>p</i>_2 = 23. It can be verified that 1219 is the smallest number such that the last digits are formed by <i>p</i>_1 whilst also being divisible by <i>p</i>_2.
In fact, with the exception of <i>p</i>_1 = 3 and <i>p</i>_2 = 5, for every pair of consecutive primes, <i>p</i>_2 &gt; <i>p</i>_1, there exist values of <i>n</i> for which the last digits are formed by <i>p</i>_1 and <i>n</i> is divisible by <i>p</i>_2. Let <i>S</i> be the smallest of these values of <i>n</i>.
Find ∑ <i>S</i> for every pair of consecutive primes with 5 ≤ <i>p</i>_1 ≤ 1000000.

Consider the consecutive primes p_1 = 19 and p_2 = 23. It can be verified that 1219 is the smallest number such that the last digits are formed by p_1 whilst also being divisible by p_2.
In fact, with the exception of p_1 = 3 and p_2 = 5, for every pair of consecutive primes, p_2 &gt; p_1, there exist values of n for which the last digits are formed by p_1 and n is divisible by p_2. Let S be the smallest of these values of n.
Find ∑ S for every pair of consecutive primes with 5 ≤ p_1 ≤ 1000000.
