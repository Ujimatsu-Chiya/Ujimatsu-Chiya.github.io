## 题目
### Composites with prime repunit property


A number consisting entirely of ones is called a repunit. We shall define R(<i>k</i>) to be a repunit of length <i>k</i>; for example, R(6) = 111111.
Given that <i>n</i> is a positive integer and GCD(<i>n</i>, 10) = 1, it can be shown that there always exists a value, <i>k</i>, for which R(<i>k</i>) is divisible by <i>n</i>, and let A(<i>n</i>) be the least such value of <i>k</i>; for example, A(7) = 6 and A(41) = 5.
You are given that for all primes, <i>p</i> &gt; 5, that <i>p</i> − 1 is divisible by A(<i>p</i>). For example, when <i>p</i> = 41, A(41) = 5, and 40 is divisible by 5.
However, there are rare composite values for which this is also true; the first five examples being 91, 259, 451, 481, and 703.
Find the sum of the first twenty-five composite values of <i>n</i> for which<br />GCD(<i>n</i>, 10) = 1 and <i>n</i> − 1 is divisible by A(<i>n</i>).

Given that n is a positive integer and GCD(n, 10) = 1, it can be shown that there always exists a value, k, for which R(k) is divisible by n, and let A(n) be the least such value of k; for example, A(7) = 6 and A(41) = 5.
