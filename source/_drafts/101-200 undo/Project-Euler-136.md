# Project Euler 136
## 题目
### Singleton difference

The positive integers, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i>, are consecutive terms of an arithmetic progression. Given that <i>n</i> is a positive integer, the equation, <i>x</i>^2 − <i>y</i>^2 − <i>z</i>^2 = <i>n</i>, has exactly one solution when <i>n</i> = 20:
<p class="center">13^2 − 10^2 − 7^2 = 20
In fact there are twenty-five values of <i>n</i> below one hundred for which the equation has a unique solution.
How many values of <i>n</i> less than fifty million have exactly one solution?
