# Project Euler 102
## 题目
### Triangle containment

Three distinct points are plotted at random on a Cartesian plane, for which -1000 ≤ <i>x</i>, <i>y</i> ≤ 1000, such that a triangle is formed.
Consider the following two triangles:
<p class="center">A(-340,495), B(-153,-910), C(835,-947)<br /><br />
X(-175,41), Y(-421,-714), Z(574,-645)
It can be verified that triangle ABC contains the origin, whereas triangle XYZ does not.
Using <a href="project/resources/p102_triangles.txt">triangles.txt</a> (right click and 'Save Link/Target As\dots'), a 27K text file containing the co-ordinates of one thousand "random" triangles, find the number of triangles for which the interior contains the origin.
<p class="smaller">NOTE: The first two examples in the file represent the triangles in the example given above.
