### Special subset sums: meta-testing

Let S(A) represent the sum of elements in set A of size <i>n</i>. We shall call it a special sum set if for any two non-empty disjoint subsets, B and C, the following properties are true:
<ol><li>S(B) ≠ S(C); that is, sums of subsets cannot be equal.</li>
<li>If B contains more elements than C then S(B) &gt; S(C).</li>
</ol>For this problem we shall assume that a given set contains <i>n</i> strictly increasing elements and it already satisfies the second rule.
Surprisingly, out of the 25 possible subset pairs that can be obtained from a set for which <i>n</i> = 4, only 1 of these pairs need to be tested for equality (first rule). Similarly, when <i>n</i> = 7, only 70 out of the 966 subset pairs need to be tested.
For <i>n</i> = 12, how many of the 261625 subset pairs that can be obtained need to be tested for equality?

### Special subset sums: meta-testing
Let $S(A)$ represent the sum of elements in set $A$ of size $n$. We shall call it a special sum set if for any two non-empty disjoint subsets, $B$ and $C$, the following properties are true:
<ol>
<li>$S(B) \neq S(C)$; that is, sums of subsets cannot be equal.</li>
<li>If $B$ contains more elements than $C$ then $S(B) &gt; S(C)$.</li>
</ol>
For this problem we shall assume that a given set contains n strictly increasing elements and it already satisfies the second rule.
Surprisingly, out of the $25$ possible subset pairs that can be obtained from a set for which $n = 4$, only $1$ of these pairs need to be tested for equality (first rule). Similarly, when $n = 7$, only $70$ out of the $966$ subset pairs need to be tested.
For $n = 12$, how many of the $261625$ subset pairs that can be obtained need to be tested for equality?
