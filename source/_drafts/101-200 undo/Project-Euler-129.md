## 题目
### Repunit divisibility


A number consisting entirely of ones is called a repunit. We shall define R(<i>k</i>) to be a repunit of length <i>k</i>; for example, R(6) = 111111.
Given that <i>n</i> is a positive integer and GCD(<i>n</i>, 10) = 1, it can be shown that there always exists a value, <i>k</i>, for which R(<i>k</i>) is divisible by <i>n</i>, and let A(<i>n</i>) be the least such value of <i>k</i>; for example, A(7) = 6 and A(41) = 5.
The least value of <i>n</i> for which A(<i>n</i>) first exceeds ten is 17.
Find the least value of <i>n</i> for which A(<i>n</i>) first exceeds one-million.
