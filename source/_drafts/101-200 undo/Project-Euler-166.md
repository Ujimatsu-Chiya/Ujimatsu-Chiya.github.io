# Project Euler 166
## 题目
### Criss Cross

A 4x4 grid is filled with digits d, 0 ≤ d ≤ 9.

It can be seen that in the grid

<p class="center">
6 3 3 0<br />
5 0 4 3<br />
0 7 1 4<br />
1 2 4 5

the sum of each row and each column has the value 12. Moreover the sum of each diagonal is also 12.

In how many ways can you fill a 4x4 grid with the digits d, 0 ≤ d ≤ 9 so that each row, each column, and both diagonals have the same sum?
