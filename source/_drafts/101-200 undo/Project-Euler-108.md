## 题目
### Diophantine reciprocals I

In the following equation <var>x</var>, <var>y</var>, and <var>n</var> are positive integers.
$$\dfrac{1}{x} + \dfrac{1}{y} = \dfrac{1}{n}$$
For <var>n</var> = 4 there are exactly three distinct solutions:
$$\begin{align}
\dfrac{1}{5} + \dfrac{1}{20} &amp;= \dfrac{1}{4}\\
\dfrac{1}{6} + \dfrac{1}{12} &amp;= \dfrac{1}{4}\\
\dfrac{1}{8} + \dfrac{1}{8} &amp;= \dfrac{1}{4}
\end{align}
$$

What is the least value of <var>n</var> for which the number of distinct solutions exceeds one-thousand?
