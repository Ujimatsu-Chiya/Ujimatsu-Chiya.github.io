There are 5 grids smaller than 3x2, vertical and horizontal dimensions being important, i.e. 1x1, 2x1, 3x1, 1x2 and 2x2. If each of them is cross-hatched, the following number of different rectangles could be situated within those smaller grids:
1x1: 1<br>2x1: 4<br>3x1: 8<br>1x2: 4<br>2x2: 18
Adding those to the 37 of the 3x2 grid, a total of 72 different rectangles could be situated within 3x2 and smaller grids.
How many different rectangles could be situated within 47x43 and smaller grids?
