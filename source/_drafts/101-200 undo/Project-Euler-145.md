## 题目
### How many reversible numbers are there below one-billion?

Some positive integers <i>n</i> have the property that the sum [ <i>n</i> + reverse(<i>n</i>) ] consists entirely of odd (decimal) digits. For instance, 36 + 63 = 99 and 409 + 904 = 1313. We will call such numbers <em>reversible</em>; so 36, 63, 409, and 904 are reversible. Leading zeroes are not allowed in either <i>n</i> or reverse(<i>n</i>).

There are 120 reversible numbers below one-thousand.

How many reversible numbers are there below one-billion (10^9)?
