# Project Euler 131
## 题目
### Prime cube partnership

There are some prime values, <i>p</i>, for which there exists a positive integer, <i>n</i>, such that the expression <i>n</i>^3 + <i>n</i>^2<i>p</i> is a perfect cube.
For example, when <i>p</i> = 19, 8^3 + 8^2×19 = 12^3.
What is perhaps most surprising is that for each prime with this property the value of <i>n</i> is unique, and there are only four such primes below one-hundred.
How many primes below one million have this remarkable property?
