# Project Euler 132
## 题目
### Large repunit factors

A number consisting entirely of ones is called a repunit. We shall define R(<i>k</i>) to be a repunit of length <i>k</i>.
For example, R(10) = 1111111111 = 11×41×271×9091, and the sum of these prime factors is 9414.
Find the sum of the first forty prime factors of R(10^9).
