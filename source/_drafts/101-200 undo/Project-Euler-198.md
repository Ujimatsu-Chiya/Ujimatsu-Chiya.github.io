### Ambiguous Numbers

A best approximation to a real number $x$ for the denominator bound $d$ is a rational number $\frac r s$ (in reduced form) with $s \le d$, so that any rational number $\frac p q$ which is closer to $x$ than $\frac r s$ has $q &gt; d$.

Usually the best approximation to a real number is uniquely determined for all denominator bounds. However, there are some exceptions, e.g. $\frac 9 {40}$ has the two best approximations $\frac 1 4$ and $\frac 1 5$ for the denominator bound $6$.
We shall call a real number $x$ <i>ambiguous</i>, if there is at least one denominator bound for which $x$ possesses two best approximations. Clearly, an ambiguous number is necessarily rational.

How many ambiguous numbers $x=\frac p q, 0 &lt; x &lt; \frac 1 {100}$, are there whose denominator $q$ does not exceed $10^8$?

### Ambiguous Numbers
A best approximation to a real number x for the denominator bound d is a rational number r/s (in reduced form) with s ≤ d, so that any rational number p/q which is closer to x than r/s has q &gt; d.
Usually the best approximation to a real number is uniquely determined for all denominator bounds. However, there are some exceptions, e.g. 9/40 has the two best approximations 1/4 and 1/5 for the denominator bound 6. We shall call a real number x <em>ambiguous</em>, if there is at least one denominator bound for which x possesses two best approximations. Clearly, an ambiguous number is necessarily rational.
How many ambiguous numbers x = p/q, 0 &lt; x &lt; 1/100, are there whose denominator q does not exceed 10^8?
