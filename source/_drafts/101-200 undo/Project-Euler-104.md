## 题目
### Pandigital Fibonacci ends


The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:
<blockquote>F_<i>n</i> = F_<i>n</i>−1 + F_<i>n</i>−2, where F_1 = 1 and F_2 = 1.</blockquote>
It turns out that F_541, which contains 113 digits, is the first Fibonacci number for which the last nine digits are 1-9 pandigital (contain all the digits 1 to 9, but not necessarily in order). And F_2749, which contains 575 digits, is the first Fibonacci number for which the first nine digits are 1-9 pandigital.
Given that F_<i>k</i> is the first Fibonacci number for which the first nine digits AND the last nine digits are 1-9 pandigital, find <i>k</i>.
