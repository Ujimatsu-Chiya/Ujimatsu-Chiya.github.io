## 题目
### Same differences

Given the positive integers, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i>, are consecutive terms of an arithmetic progression, the least value of the positive integer, <i>n</i>, for which the equation, <i>x</i>^2 − <i>y</i>^2 − <i>z</i>^2 = <i>n</i>, has exactly two solutions is <i>n</i> = 27:
<p class="center">34^2 − 27^2 − 20^2 = 12^2 − 9^2 − 6^2 = 27
It turns out that <i>n</i> = 1155 is the least value which has exactly ten solutions.
How many values of <i>n</i> less than one million have exactly ten distinct solutions?
