# Project Euler 119
## 题目
### Digit power sum

The number 512 is interesting because it is equal to the sum of its digits raised to some power: 5 + 1 + 2 = 8, and 8^3 = 512. Another example of a number with this property is 614656 = 28^4.
We shall define <i>a</i>_n to be the <i>n</i>th term of this sequence and insist that a number must contain at least two digits to have a sum.
You are given that <i>a</i>_2 = 512 and <i>a</i>_10 = 614656.
Find <i>a</i>_30.
