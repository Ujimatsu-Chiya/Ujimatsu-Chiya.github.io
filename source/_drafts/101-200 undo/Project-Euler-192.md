## 题目
### Best Approximations

Let $x$ be a real number.<br />
A <b>best approximation</b> to $x$ for the <b>denominator bound</b> $d$ is a rational number $\frac r s $  in<b> reduced form</b>, with $s \le d$, such that any rational number which is closer to $x$ than $\frac r s$ has a denominator larger than $d$:

<div class="center"> $|\frac p q -x | &lt; |\frac r s -x| \Rightarrow q &gt; d$

### Best Approximations
Let x be a real number.<br>A best approximation to x for the denominator bound d is a rational number r/s in reduced form, with s ≤ d, such that any rational number which is closer to x than r/s has a denominator larger than d:
<center>|p/q-x| &lt; |r/s-x| ⇒ q &gt; d</center>

For example, the best approximation to √13 for the denominator bound 20 is 18/5 and the best approximation to √13 for the denominator bound 30 is 101/28.
Find the sum of all denominators of the best approximations to √n for the denominator bound 10^12, where n is not a perfect square and 1 &lt; n ≤ 100000.
