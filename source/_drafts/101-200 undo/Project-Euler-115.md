## 题目
### Counting block combinations II

<p class="note">NOTE: This is a more difficult version of <a href="problem=114">Problem 114</a>.
A row measuring <i>n</i> units in length has red blocks with a minimum length of <i>m</i> units placed on it, such that any two red blocks (which are allowed to be different lengths) are separated by at least one black square.
Let the fill-count function, F(<i>m</i>, <i>n</i>), represent the number of ways that a row can be filled.
For example, F(3, 29) = 673135 and F(3, 30) = 1089155.
That is, for <i>m</i> = 3, it can be seen that <i>n</i> = 30 is the smallest value for which the fill-count function first exceeds one million.
In the same way, for <i>m</i> = 10, it can be verified that F(10, 56) = 880711 and F(10, 57) = 1148904, so <i>n</i> = 57 is the least value for which the fill-count function first exceeds one million.
For <i>m</i> = 50, find the least value of <i>n</i> for which the fill-count function first exceeds one million.

### Counting block combinations II
NOTE: This is a more difficult version of <a href="/Problem101-125/#Problem_114">Problem 114</a>.
A row measuring n units in length has red blocks with a minimum length of m units placed on it, such that any two red blocks (which are allowed to be different lengths) are separated by at least one black square.
Let the fill-count function, F(m, n), represent the number of ways that a row can be filled.
For example, F(3, 29) = 673135 and F(3, 30) = 1089155.
That is, for m = 3, it can be seen that n = 30 is the smallest value for which the fill-count function first exceeds one million.
In the same way, for m = 10, it can be verified that F(10, 56) = 880711 and F(10, 57) = 1148904, so n = 57 is the least value for which the fill-count function first exceeds one million.
For m = 50, find the least value of n for which the fill-count function first exceeds one million.
