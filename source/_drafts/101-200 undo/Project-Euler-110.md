## 题目
### Diophantine reciprocals II

In the following equation <var>x</var>, <var>y</var>, and <var>n</var> are positive integers.
$$\dfrac{1}{x} + \dfrac{1}{y} = \dfrac{1}{n}$$

It can be verified that when $n = 1260$ there are 113 distinct solutions and this is the least value of $n$ for which the total number of distinct solutions exceeds one hundred.
What is the least value of $n$ for which the number of distinct solutions exceeds four million?

## 题目
### Diophantine reciprocals II
In the following equation x, y, and n are positive integers.
$$\frac{1}{x}+\frac{1}{y}=\frac{1}{n}$$
For n = 4 there are exactly three distinct solutions:
$$\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{20}=\frac{1}{4}$$ $$\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{12}=\frac{1}{4}$$ $$\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{8}=\frac{1}{4}$$
It can be verified that when n = 1260 there are 113 distinct solutions and this is the least value of n for which the total number of distinct solutions exceeds one hundred.
What is the least value of n for which the number of distinct solutions exceeds four million?
