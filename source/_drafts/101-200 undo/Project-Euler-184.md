## 题目
### Triangles containing the origin

Consider the set <var>I_r</var> of points (<var>x</var>,<var>y</var>) with integer co-ordinates in the interior of the circle with radius <var>r</var>, centered at the origin, i.e. <var>x</var>^2 + <var>y</var>^2 &lt; <var>r</var>^2.
For a radius of 2, <var>I</var>_2 contains the nine points (0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (0,1), (-1,1), (-1,0), (-1,-1), (0,-1) and (1,-1). There are eight triangles having all three vertices in <var>I</var>_2 which contain the origin in the interior. Two of them are shown below, the others are obtained from these by rotation.

For a radius of 3, there are 360 triangles containing the origin in the interior and having all vertices in <var>I</var>_3 and for <var>I</var>_5 the number is 10600.

How many triangles are there containing the origin in the interior and having all three vertices in <var>I</var>_105?
