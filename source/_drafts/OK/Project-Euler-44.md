# Project Euler 44
## 题目
### Pentagon numbers
Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula, $P_n=\frac{n(3n−1)}{2}$. The first ten pentagonal numbers are:
$$1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145,\dots$$

It can be seen that $P_4 + P_7 = 22 + 70 = 92 = P_8$. However, their difference, $70 − 22 = 48$, is not pentagonal.

Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, $P_j$ and $P_k$, for which their sum and difference are pentagonal and $D = |P_k − P_j|$ is minimised; what is the value of $D$?

## 解决方案


本代码使用gmpy2库的is_square函数和isqrt函数。之后这两个函数将封装进自定义的tools工具包中。
