### Counting the number of "hollow" square laminae that can form one, two, three, ... distinct arrangements


We shall define a square lamina to be a square outline with a square "hole" so that the shape possesses vertical and horizontal symmetry.
Given eight tiles it is possible to form a lamina in only one way: 3x3 square with a 1x1 hole in the middle. However, using thirty-two tiles it is possible to form two distinct laminae.

### Counting the number of “hollow” square laminae that can form one, two, three, … distinct arrangements
We shall define a square lamina to be a square outline with a square “hole” so that the shape possesses vertical and horizontal symmetry.

Given eight tiles it is possible to form a lamina in only one way: $3\times 3$ square with a $1\times1$ hole in the middle. However, using thirty-two tiles it is possible to form two distinct laminae.

![](../images/p173_square_laminas.gif)

If $t$ represents the number of tiles used, we shall say that $t = 8$ is type $L(1)$ and $t = 32$ is type $L(2)$.

Let $N(n)$ be the number of $t \le 1000000$ such that $t$ is type $L(n)$; for example, $N(15)$ = $832$.

What is $\sum N(n)$ for $1 ≤ n ≤ 10$?
