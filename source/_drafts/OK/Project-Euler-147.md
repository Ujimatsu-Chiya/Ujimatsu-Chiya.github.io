### Rectangles in cross-hatched grids
In a $3\times2$ cross-hatched grid, a total of $37$ different rectangles could be situated within that grid as indicated in the sketch.

![](../images/p147.png)

There are $5$ grids smaller than $3\times2$, vertical and horizontal dimensions being important, i.e. $1\times1$, $2\times1$, $3\times1$, $1\times2$ and $2\times2$. If each of them is cross-hatched, the following number of different rectangles could be situated within those smaller grids:
$\begin{aligned}
1\times1&: 1 \\
2\times1&: 4 \\
3\times1&: 8 \\
1\times2&: 4 \\
2\times2&: 18
\end{aligned}$

Adding those to the $37$ of the $3\times2$ grid, a total of $72$ different rectangles could be situated within $3\times2$ and smaller grids.

How many different rectangles could be situated within $47\times43$ and smaller grids?
