### Ambiguous Numbers

A best approximation to a real number $x$ for the denominator bound $d$ is a rational number $\dfrac{r}{s}$ (in reduced form) with $s \le d$, so that any rational number $\dfrac{p}{q}$ which is closer to $x$ than $\dfrac{r}{s}$ has $q > d$.

Usually the best approximation to a real number is uniquely determined for all denominator bounds. However, there are some exceptions, e.g. $\dfrac{9}{40}$ has the two best approximations $\dfrac{1}{4}$ and $\dfrac{1}{5}$ for the denominator bound $6$. We shall call a real number $x$ *ambiguous*, if there is at least one denominator bound for which $x$ possesses two best approximations. Clearly, an ambiguous number is necessarily rational.

How many ambiguous numbers $x=\dfrac{p}{q}$, $0 < x < \dfrac{1}{100}$, are there whose denominator $q$ does not exceed $10^8$?
