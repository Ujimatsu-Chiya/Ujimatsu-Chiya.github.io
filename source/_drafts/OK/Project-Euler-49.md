# Project Euler 49

### Prime permutations
The arithmetic sequence, $1487, 4817, 8147$, in which each of the terms increases by $3330$, is unusual in two ways: (i) each of the three terms are prime, and, (ii) each of the 4-digit numbers are permutations of one another.

There are no arithmetic sequences made up of three $1$-, $2$-, or $3$-digit primes, exhibiting this property, but there is one other $4$-digit increasing sequence.

What $12$-digit number do you form by concatenating the three terms in this sequence?
