# Project Euler 77
## 题目
### Prime summations
It is possible to write ten as the sum of primes in exactly five different ways:

$7 + 3$ 
$5 + 5$ 
$5 + 3 + 2$ 
$3 + 3 + 2 + 2$
$2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2$

What is the first value which can be written as the sum of primes in over five thousand different ways?
