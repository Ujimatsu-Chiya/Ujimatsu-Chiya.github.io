### Ordered fractions
Consider the fraction, $\dfrac{n}{d}$, where n and d are positive integers. If $n<d$ and $\gcd(n,d)=1$, it is called a reduced proper fraction.
If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for $d \leq 8$ in ascending order of size, we get:

$$\dfrac{1}{8},\dfrac{1}{7},\dfrac{1}{6},\dfrac{1}{5},\dfrac{1}{4},\dfrac{2}{7},\dfrac{1}{3},\dfrac{3}{8},\mathbf{\dfrac{2}{5}},\dfrac{3}{7},\dfrac{1}{2},\dfrac{4}{7},\dfrac{3}{5},\dfrac{5}{8},\dfrac{2}{3},\dfrac{5}{7},\dfrac{3}{4},\dfrac{4}{5},\dfrac{5}{6},\dfrac{6}{7},\dfrac{7}{8}$$

It can be seen that $\dfrac{2}{5}$ is the fraction immediately to the left of $\dfrac{3}{7}$.
By listing the set of reduced proper fractions for $d \leq 1,000,000$ in ascending order of size, find the numerator of the fraction immediately to the left of $\dfrac{3}{7}$.
