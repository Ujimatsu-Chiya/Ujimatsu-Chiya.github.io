## 题目
### Four Representations using Squares

Consider the number 3600. It is very special, because

$$\begin{aligned}
3600 &= 48^2 + 36^2 \\
3600 &= 20^2 + 2\times40^2 \\
3600 &= 30^2 + 3\times30^2 \\
3600 &= 45^2 + 7\times15^2 \\
\end{aligned}$$

Similarly, we find that $88201 = 99^2 + 280^2 = 287^2 + 2\times54^2 = 283^2 + 3\times52^2 = 197^2 + 7\times84^2$.

In 1747, Euler proved which numbers are representable as a sum of two squares.

We are interested in the numbers n which admit representations of all of the following four types:

$$\begin{aligned}
n &= a_1^2 + b_1^2\\
n &= a_2^2 + 2 b_2^2\\
n &= a_3^2 + 3 b_3^2\\
n &= a_7^2 + 7 b_7^2,\\
\end{aligned}$$

where the $a_k$ and $b_k$ are positive integers.

There are $75373$ such numbers that do not exceed $10^7$.

How many such numbers are there that do not exceed $2\times10^9$?
