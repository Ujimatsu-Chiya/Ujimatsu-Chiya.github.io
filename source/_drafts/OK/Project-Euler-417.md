### Reciprocal cycles II


A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation of the unit fractions with denominators 2 to 10 are given:

$\begin{aligned}
&\dfrac{1}{2}=0.5\\
&\dfrac{1}{3}=0.(3)\\
&\dfrac{1}{4}=0.25\\
&\dfrac{1}{5}=0.2\\
&\dfrac{1}{6}=0.1(6)\\
&\dfrac{1}{7}=0.(142857)\\
&\dfrac{1}{8}=0.125\\
&\dfrac{1}{9}=0.(1)\\
&\dfrac{1}{10}=0.1\\
\end{aligned}$


Where $0.1(6)$ means $0.166666\dots$, and has a $1$-digit recurring cycle. It can be seen that $\dfrac{1}{7}$ has a $6$-digit recurring cycle.

Unit fractions whose denominator has no other prime factors than $2$ and/or $5$ are not considered to have a recurring cycle.

We define the length of the recurring cycle of those unit fractions as $0$. 


Let $L(n)$ denote the length of the recurring cycle of $\dfrac{1}{n}$.

You are given that $\sum L(n)$ for $3 \le n \le 1 000 000$ equals $55535191115$.


Find $\sum L(n)$ for $3 \le n \le 100 000 000$.
