## 题目
### Top Dice


There are $1111$ ways in which five $6$-sided dice (sides numbered $1$ to $6$) can be rolled so that the top three sum to $15$. Some examples are:

$\begin{aligned}
D_1,D_2,D_3,D_4,D_5 = 4,3,6,3,5\\
D_1,D_2,D_3,D_4,D_5 = 4,3,3,5,6\\
D_1,D_2,D_3,D_4,D_5 = 3,3,3,6,6\\
D_1,D_2,D_3,D_4,D_5 = 6,6,3,3,3
\end{aligned}$

In how many ways can twenty $12$-sided dice (sides numbered $1$ to $12$) be rolled so that the top ten sum to $70$?





## 解决方案

令$N=12,S=70,T=2$。
