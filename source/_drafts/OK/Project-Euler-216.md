## 题目
### Investigating the primality of numbers of the form $2n^2-1$

Consider numbers $t(n)$ of the form $t(n) = 2n^2-1$ with $n > 1$.

The first such numbers are $7, 17, 31, 49, 71, 97, 127$ and $161$.

It turns out that only $49 = 7*7$ and $161 = 7*23$ are not prime.

For $n \le 10000$ there are $2202$ numbers $t(n)$ that are prime.

How many numbers $t(n)$ are prime for $n \le 50,000,000$ ?
