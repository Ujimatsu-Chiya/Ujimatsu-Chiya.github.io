## 题目
### Cuboid layers
The minimum number of cubes to cover every visible face on a cuboid measuring $3\times2\times1$ is twenty-two.

![](../images/p126.png)

If we then add a second layer to this solid it would require forty-six cubes to cover every visible face, the third layer would require seventy-eight cubes, and the fourth layer would require one-hundred and eighteen cubes to cover every visible face.

However, the first layer on a cuboid measuring $5\times1\times1$ also requires twenty-two cubes; similarly the first layer on cuboids measuring $5\times3\times1$, $7\times2\times1$, and $11\times1\times1$ all contain forty-six cubes.

We shall define $C(n)$ to represent the number of cuboids that contain $n$ cubes in one of its layers. So $C(22) = 2$, $C(46) = 4$, $C(78) = 5$, and $C(118) = 8$.

It turns out that $154$ is the least value of $n$ for which $C(n) = 10$.

Find the least value of $n$ for which $C(n) = 1000$.
