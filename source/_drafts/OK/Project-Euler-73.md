### Counting fractions in a range

Consider the fraction, $\dfrac{n}{d}$, where n and d are positive integers. If $n<d$ and $\gcd(n,d)=1$, it is called a reduced proper fraction.
If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for $d \leq 8$ in ascending order of size, we get:

$$\dfrac{1}{8},\dfrac{1}{7},\dfrac{1}{6},\dfrac{1}{5},\dfrac{1}{4},\dfrac{2}{7},\dfrac{1}{3},\mathbf{\dfrac{3}{8},\dfrac{2}{5},\dfrac{3}{7}},\dfrac{1}{2},\dfrac{4}{7},\dfrac{3}{5},\dfrac{5}{8},\dfrac{2}{3},\dfrac{5}{7},\dfrac{3}{4},\dfrac{4}{5},\dfrac{5}{6},\dfrac{6}{7},\dfrac{7}{8}$$

It can be seen that there are $3$ fractions between $\dfrac{1}{3}$ and $\dfrac{1}{2}$.

How many fractions lie between $\dfrac{1}{3}$ and $\dfrac{1}{2}$ in the sorted set of reduced proper fractions for $d \leq 12,000$?
