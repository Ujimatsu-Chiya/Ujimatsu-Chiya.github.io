## 题目
### Digit power sum


The number $512$ is interesting because it is equal to the sum of its digits raised to some power: $5 + 1 + 2 = 8$, and $8^3 = 512$. Another example of a number with this property is $614656 = 28^4$.

We shall define $a_n$ to be the $n^\mathrm{th}$ term of this sequence and insist that a number must contain at least two digits to have a sum.

You are given that $a_2 = 512$ and $a_{10} = 614656$.

Find $a_30$.
