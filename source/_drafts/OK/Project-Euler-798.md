### Card Stacking Game



Two players play a game with a deck of cards which contains $s$ suits with each suit containing $n$ cards numbered from $1$ to $n$.


Before the game starts, a set of cards (which may be empty) is picked from the deck and placed face-up on the table, with no overlap. These are called the visible cards.


The players then make moves in turn.

A move consists of choosing a card $X$ from the rest of the deck and placing it face-up on top of a visible card $Y$, subject to the following restrictions:

- $X$ and $Y$ must be the same suit;
- the value of $X$ must be larger than the value of $Y$.


The card $X$ then covers the card $Y$ and replaces $Y$ as a visible card.

The player unable to make a valid move loses and play stops.


Let $C(n, s)$ be the number of different initial sets of cards for which the first player will lose given best play for both players.


For example, $C(3, 2) = 26$ and $C(13, 4) \equiv 540318329 \pmod {1\,000\,000\,007}$.


Find $C(10^7, 10^7)$. Give your answer modulo $1\,000\,000\,007$.
