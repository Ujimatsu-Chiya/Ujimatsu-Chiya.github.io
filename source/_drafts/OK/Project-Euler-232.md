## 题目
### The Race


Two players share an unbiased coin and take it in turns to play *The Race*.

On Player $1$'s turn, the coin is tossed once. If it comes up Heads, then Player $1$ scores one point; if it comes up Tails, then no points are scored.

On Player $2$'s turn, a positive integer, $T$, is chosen by Player $2$ and the coin is tossed $T$ times. If it comes up all Heads, then Player $2$ scores $2^{T-1}$ points; otherwise, no points are scored.

Player $1$ goes first and the winner is the first to $100$ or more points.

Player $2$ will always selects the number, $T$, of coin tosses that maximises the probability of winning.

What is the probability that Player $2$ wins?

Give your answer rounded to eight decimal places in the form $0.abcdefgh$.
