### Special subset sums: meta-testing


Let $S(A)$ represent the sum of elements in set $A$ of size $n$. We shall call it a special sum set if for any two non-empty disjoint subsets, $B$ and $C$, the following properties are true:

1. $S(B) \neq S(C)$; that is, sums of subsets cannot be equal.
2. If $B$ contains more elements than $C$ then $S(B) > S(C)$.

For this problem we shall assume that a given set contains n strictly increasing elements and it already satisfies the second rule.

Surprisingly, out of the $25$ possible subset pairs that can be obtained from a set for which $n = 4$, only $1$ of these pairs need to be tested for equality (first rule). Similarly, when $n = 7$, only $70$ out of the $966$ subset pairs need to be tested.

For $n = 12$, how many of the $261625$ subset pairs that can be obtained need to be tested for equality?

NOTE: This problem is related to <a href="/103">Problem 103</a> and <a href="/105">Problem 105</a>.
