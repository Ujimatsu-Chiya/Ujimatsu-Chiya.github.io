### Triangular, pentagonal, and hexagonal

Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following formulae:

||||
|---|---|---|
|Triangle|$T_n=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$|$1, 3, 6, 10, 15,\dots$|
|Pentagonal|$P_n=\frac{n(3n−1)}{2}$|$1, 5, 12, 22, 35, \dots$|
|Hexagonal|$H_n=n(2n−1)$|$1, 6, 15, 28, 45, \dots$|

It can be verified that $T_{285} = P_{165} = H_{143} = 40755$.

Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.
