### Best Approximations

Let x be a real number.

A best approximation to $x$ for the denominator bound $d$ is a rational number $\dfrac{r}{s}$ in reduced form, with $s \le d$, such that any rational number which is closer to $x$ than $\dfrac{r}{s}$ has a denominator larger than $d$:
 
$$|\dfrac{p}{q}-x| < |\dfrac{r}{s}-x| \Rightarrow q > d$$

For example, the best approximation to $\sqrt{13}$ for the denominator bound $20$ is $\dfrac{18}{5}$ and the best approximation to $\sqrt{13}$ for the denominator bound $30$ is $\dfrac{101}{28}$.

Find the sum of all denominators of the best approximations to $\sqrt{n}$ for the denominator bound $10^{12}$, where $n$ is not a perfect square and $1 < n \le 100000$.
