# Project Euler 102
## 题目
### Triangle containment


Three distinct points are plotted at random on a Cartesian plane, for which $-1000 \leq x,y\leq  1000$, such that a triangle is formed.

Consider the following two triangles:

$$A(-340,495), B(-153,-910), C(835,-947)$$
$$X(-175,41), Y(-421,-714), Z(574,-645)$$

It can be verified that triangle $ABC$ contains the origin, whereas triangle $XYZ$ does not.

Using [triangles.txt](../resources/p102_triangles.txt) (right click and 'Save Link/Target As\dots'), a 27K text file containing the co-ordinates of one thousand "random" triangles, find the number of triangles for which the interior contains the origin.

NOTE: The first two examples in the file represent the triangles in the example given above.
