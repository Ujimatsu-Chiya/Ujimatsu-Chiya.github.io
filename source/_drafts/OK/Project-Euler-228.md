## 题目
### Minkowski Sums

Let $S_n$ be the regular $n$-sided polygon – or *shape* – whose vertices $v_k (k=1,2,\dots,n)$ have coordinates:

$$x_k= \cos(\dfrac{2k-1}{n} \times 180°)\quad y_k= \sin(\dfrac{2k-1}{n} \times 180°)$$

Each $S_n$ is to be interpreted as a filled shape consisting of all points on the perimeter and in the interior.

The *Minkowski sum*, $S+T$, of two shapes $S$ and $T$ is the result of adding every point in $S$ to every point in $T$, where point addition is performed coordinate-wise: $(u,v) + (x,y) = (u+x,v+y)$.

For example, the sum of $S_3$ and $S_4$ is the six-sided shape shown in pink below:

How many sides does $S_{1864}+S_{1865}+\dots+S_{1909}$ have?
