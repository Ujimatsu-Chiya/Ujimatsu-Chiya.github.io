### Integer angled Quadrilaterals

Let ABCD be a convex quadrilateral, with diagonals AC and BD. At each vertex the diagonal makes an angle with each of the two sides, creating eight corner angles.

For example, at vertex $A$, the two angles are $CAD, CAB$.

We call such a quadrilateral for which all eight corner angles have integer values when measured in degrees an “integer angled quadrilateral”. An example of an integer angled quadrilateral is a square, where all eight corner angles are $45°$. Another example is given by $DAC = 20°, BAC = 60°, ABD = 50°, CBD = 30°, BCA = 40°, DCA = 30°, CDB = 80°, ADB = 50°$.

What is the total number of non-similar integer angled quadrilaterals?

Note: In your calculations you may assume that a calculated angle is integral if it is within a tolerance of $10^{-9}$ of an integer value.
