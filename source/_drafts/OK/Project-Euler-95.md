### Amicable chains
The proper divisors of a number are all the divisors excluding the number itself. For example, the proper divisors of $28$ are $1, 2, 4, 7$, and $14$. As the sum of these divisors is equal to $28$, we call it a perfect number.

Interestingly the sum of the proper divisors of $220$ is $284$ and the sum of the proper divisors of $284$ is $220$, forming a chain of two numbers. For this reason, $220$ and $284$ are called an amicable pair.

Perhaps less well known are longer chains. For example, starting with $12496$, we form a chain of five numbers:

$$ 12496 \rightarrow 14288 \rightarrow 15472 \rightarrow 14536 \rightarrow 14264 (\rightarrow 12496 \rightarrow \dots)$$

Since this chain returns to its starting point, it is called an amicable chain.

Find the smallest member of the longest amicable chain with no element exceeding one million.
