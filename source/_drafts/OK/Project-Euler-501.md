## 题目
### Eight Divisors

The eight divisors of $24$ are $1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12$ and $24$.

The ten numbers not exceeding $100$ having exactly eight divisors are $24, 30, 40, 42, 54, 56, 66, 70, 78$ and $88$.

Let $f(n)$ be the count of numbers not exceeding $n$ with exactly eight divisors.

You are given $f(100)=10, f(1000)=180$ and $f(10^6)=224427$.

Find $f(10^{12})$.
