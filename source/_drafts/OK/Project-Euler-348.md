## 题目
### Sum of a square and a cube


Many numbers can be expressed as the sum of a square and a cube. Some of them in more than one way.

Consider the palindromic numbers that can be expressed as the sum of a square and a cube, both greater than $1$, in **exactly** $4$ different ways.

For example, $5229225$ is a palindromic number and it can be expressed in exactly $4$ different ways:

$\begin{aligned}
& 2285^2 + 20^3\\
& 2223^2 + 66^3\\
& 1810^2 + 125^3\\
& 1197^2 + 156^3\\
\end{aligned}$
 
Find the sum of the five smallest such palindromic numbers.
