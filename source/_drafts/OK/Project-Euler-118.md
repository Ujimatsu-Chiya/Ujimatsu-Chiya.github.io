## 题目
### Pandigital prime sets


Using all of the digits $1$ through $9$ and concatenating them freely to form decimal integers, different sets can be formed. Interestingly with the set $\{2,5,47,89,631\}$, all of the elements belonging to it are prime.

How many distinct sets containing each of the digits one through nine exactly once contain only prime elements?
