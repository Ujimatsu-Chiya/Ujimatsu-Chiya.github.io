### Step Numbers

Consider the number $45656$.

It can be seen that each pair of consecutive digits of $45656$ has a difference of one.

A number for which every pair of consecutive digits has a difference of one is called a step number.

A pandigital number contains every decimal digit from $0$ to $9$ at least once.

How many pandigital step numbers less than $10^{40}$ are there?
