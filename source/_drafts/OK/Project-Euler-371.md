## 题目
### Licence plates



Oregon licence plates consist of three letters followed by a three digit number (each digit can be from $[0..9]$).

While driving to work Seth plays the following game:

Whenever the numbers of two licence plates seen on his trip add to $1000$ that's a win.


E.g. $\text{MIC}-012$ and $\text{HAN}-988$ is a win and $\text{RYU}-500$ and $\text{SET}-500$ too (as long as he sees them in the same trip). 


Find the expected number of plates he needs to see for a win.

Give your answer rounded to 8 decimal places behind the decimal point.


**Note:** We assume that each licence plate seen is equally likely to have any three digit number on it.
