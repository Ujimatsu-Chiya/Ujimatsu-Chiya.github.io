### Maximum path sum II

By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is $23$.
<center style="font-family:'Courier New',monospace;">
<font color=red>3</font><br/>
<font color=red>7</font> 4<br/>
2 <font color=red>4</font> 6<br/>
8 5 <font color=red>9</font> 3<br/>
</center>

That is, $3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23$.

Find the maximum total from top to bottom in [triangle.txt](./resources/p067_triangle.txt) (right click and ‘Save Link/Target As…’), a 15K text file containing a triangle with one-hundred rows.

**NOTE:** This is a much more difficult version of <a href="/18">Problem 18</a>. It is not possible to try every route to solve this problem, as there are 2^99 altogether! If you could check one trillion (10^12) routes every second it would take over twenty billion years to check them all. There is an efficient algorithm to solve it. ;o)
