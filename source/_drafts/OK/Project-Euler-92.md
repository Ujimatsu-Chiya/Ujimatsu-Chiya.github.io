# Project Euler 92
## 题目
### Square digit chains
A number chain is created by continuously adding the square of the digits in a number to form a new number until it has been seen before.

For example,

$44 \rightarrow 32 \rightarrow 13 \rightarrow 10 \rightarrow \mathbf{1} \rightarrow \mathbf{1}$
$85 \rightarrow \mathbf{89}  \rightarrow 145 \rightarrow 42 \rightarrow 20 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 16 \rightarrow 37 \rightarrow 58 \rightarrow \mathbf{89}$

Therefore any chain that arrives at $1$ or $89$ will become stuck in an endless loop. What is most amazing is that EVERY starting number will eventually arrive at $1$ or $89$.

How many starting numbers below ten million will arrive at $89$?
