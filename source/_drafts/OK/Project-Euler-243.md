## 题目
### Resilience

A positive fraction whose numerator is less than its denominator is called a proper fraction.

For any denominator, $d$, there will be $d−1$ proper fractions; for example, with $d=12$:

$\dfrac{1}{12},\dfrac{2}{12},\dfrac{3}{12},\dfrac{4}{12},\dfrac{5}{12},\dfrac{6}{12},\dfrac{7}{12},\dfrac{8}{12},\dfrac{9}{12},\dfrac{10}{12},\dfrac{11}{12}$

We shall call a fraction that cannot be cancelled down a *resilient fraction*.

Furthermore we shall define the *resilience* of a denominator, $R(d)$, to be the ratio of its proper fractions that are resilient; for example, $R(12) = \dfrac{4}{11}$ .

In fact, $d=12$ is the smallest denominator having a resilience $R(d) < \dfrac{4}{10}$.

Find the smallest denominator $d$, having a resilience $R(d) < \dfrac{15499}{94744}$ .
