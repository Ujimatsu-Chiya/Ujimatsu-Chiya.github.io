### Reversible prime squares



Both $169$ and $961$ are the square of a prime. $169$ is the reverse of $961$.


We call a number a *reversible prime square* if:

1. It is not a palindrome, and
2. It is the square of a prime, and
3. Its reverse is also the square of a prime.

$169$ and $961$ are not palindromes, so both are reversible prime squares.

Find the sum of the first $50$ reversible prime squares.
