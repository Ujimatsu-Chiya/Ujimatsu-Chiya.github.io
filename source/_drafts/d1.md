### Totient permutation


Euler's Totient function, φ(<var>n</var>) [sometimes called the phi function], is used to determine the number of positive numbers less than or equal to <var>n</var> which are relatively prime to <var>n</var>. For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, are all less than nine and relatively prime to nine, φ(9)=6.The number 1 is considered to be relatively prime to every positive number, so φ(1)=1. 
Interestingly, φ(87109)=79180, and it can be seen that 87109 is a permutation of 79180.
Find the value of <var>n</var>, 1 &lt; <var>n</var> &lt; 10 ^7, for which φ(<var>n</var>) is a permutation of <var>n</var> and the ratio <var>n</var>/φ(<var>n</var>) produces a minimum.

### Ordered fractions


Consider the fraction, <i>n/d</i>, where <i>n</i> and <i>d</i> are positive integers. If <i>n</i>&lt;<i>d</i> and HCF(<i>n,d</i>)=1, it is called a reduced proper fraction.
If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for <i>d</i> ≤ 8 in ascending order of size, we get:
<p class="center smaller">1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 2/7, 1/3, 3/8, <b>2/5</b>, 3/7, 1/2, 4/7, 3/5, 5/8, 2/3, 5/7, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8
It can be seen that 2/5 is the fraction immediately to the left of 3/7.
By listing the set of reduced proper fractions for <i>d</i> ≤ 1,000,000 in ascending order of size, find the numerator of the fraction immediately to the left of 3/7.

Consider the fraction, <i>n/d</i>, where <i>n</i> and <i>d</i> are positive integers. If <i>n</i>&lt;<i>d</i> and HCF(<i>n,d</i>)=1, it is called a reduced proper fraction.
If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for <i>d</i> ≤ 8 in ascending order of size, we get:

It can be seen that there are 3 fractions between 1/3 and 1/2.

### Digit factorial chains


The number 145 is well known for the property that the sum of the factorial of its digits is equal to 145:
<p class="margin_left">1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145
Perhaps less well known is 169, in that it produces the longest chain of numbers that link back to 169; it turns out that there are only three such loops that exist:
<p class="margin_left">169 → 363601 → 1454 → 169
871 → 45361 → 871
872 → 45362 → 872
It is not difficult to prove that EVERY starting number will eventually get stuck in a loop. For example,
<p class="margin_left">69 → 363600 → 1454 → 169 → 363601 (→ 1454)
78 → 45360 → 871 → 45361 (→ 871)
540 → 145 (→ 145)
Starting with 69 produces a chain of five non-repeating terms, but the longest non-repeating chain with a starting number below one million is sixty terms.
How many chains, with a starting number below one million, contain exactly sixty non-repeating terms?

### Singular integer right triangles


It turns out that 12 cm is the smallest length of wire that can be bent to form an integer sided right angle triangle in exactly one way, but there are many more examples.

In contrast, some lengths of wire, like 20 cm, cannot be bent to form an integer sided right angle triangle, and other lengths allow more than one solution to be found; for example, using 120 cm it is possible to form exactly three different integer sided right angle triangles.
<p class="margin_left"><b>120 cm</b>: (30,40,50), (20,48,52), (24,45,51)

### Passcode derivation


A common security method used for online banking is to ask the user for three random characters from a passcode. For example, if the passcode was 531278, they may ask for the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th characters; the expected reply would be: 317.

### Product-sum numbers



A natural number, N, that can be written as the sum and product of a given set of at least two natural numbers, {<i>a</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>a</i><sub>2</sub>, ... , <i>a</i><sub><i>k</i></sub>} is called a product-sum number: N = <i>a</i><sub>1</sub> + <i>a</i><sub>2</sub> + ... + <i>a</i><sub><i>k</i></sub> = <i>a</i><sub>1</sub> × <i>a</i><sub>2</sub> × ... × <i>a</i><sub><i>k</i></sub>.
For example, 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 1 × 2 × 3.
For a given set of size, <i>k</i>, we shall call the smallest N with this property a minimal product-sum number. The minimal product-sum numbers for sets of size, <i>k</i> = 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are as follows.
<p class="margin_left"><i>k</i>=2: 4 = 2 × 2 = 2 + 2<i>k</i>=3: 6 = 1 × 2 × 3 = 1 + 2 + 3<i>k</i>=4: 8 = 1 × 1 × 2 × 4 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4<i>k</i>=5: 8 = 1 × 1 × 2 × 2 × 2  = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2<i>k</i>=6: 12 = 1 × 1 × 1 × 1 × 2 × 6 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 6
Hence for 2≤<i>k</i>≤6, the sum of all the minimal product-sum numbers is 4+6+8+12 = 30; note that 8 is only counted once in the sum.
In fact, as the complete set of minimal product-sum numbers for 2≤<i>k</i>≤12 is {4, 6, 8, 12, 15, 16}, the sum is 61.
What is the sum of all the minimal product-sum numbers for 2≤<i>k</i>≤12000?

### Roman numerals


For a number written in Roman numerals to be considered valid there are basic rules which must be followed. Even though the rules allow some numbers to be expressed in more than one way there is always a "best" way of writing a particular number.
For example, it would appear that there are at least six ways of writing the number sixteen:
<p class="margin_left monospace">IIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
VIIIIIIIIIII
VVIIIIII
XIIIIII
VVVI
XVI
However, according to the rules only <span class="monospace">XIIIIII</span> and <span class="monospace">XVI</span> are valid, and the last example is considered to be the most efficient, as it uses the least number of numerals.
The 11K text file, <a href="project/resources/p089_roman.txt">roman.txt</a> (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), contains one thousand numbers written in valid, but not necessarily minimal, Roman numerals; see <a href="about=roman_numerals">About...

### Square digit chains



A number chain is created by continuously adding the square of the digits in a number to form a new number until it has been seen before.
For example,
<p class="margin_left">44 → 32 → 13 → 10 → <b>1</b> → <b>1</b>
85 → <b>89</b> → 145 → 42 → 20 → 4 → 16 → 37 → 58 → <b>89</b>
Therefore any chain that arrives at 1 or 89 will become stuck in an endless loop. What is most amazing is that EVERY starting number will eventually arrive at 1 or 89.
How many starting numbers below ten million will arrive at 89?

### Arithmetic expressions


By using each of the digits from the set, {1, 2, 3, 4}, exactly once, and making use of the four arithmetic operations (+, −, *, /) and brackets/parentheses, it is possible to form different positive integer targets.
For example,
<p class="monospace margin_left">8 = (4 * (1 + 3)) / 2
14 = 4 * (3 + 1 / 2)
19 = 4 * (2 + 3) − 1
36 = 3 * 4 * (2 + 1)
Note that concatenations of the digits, like 12 + 34, are not allowed.
Using the set, {1, 2, 3, 4}, it is possible to obtain thirty-one different target numbers of which 36 is the maximum, and each of the numbers 1 to 28 can be obtained before encountering the first non-expressible number.
Find the set of four distinct digits, <i>a</i> &lt; <i>b</i> &lt; <i>c</i> &lt; <i>d</i>, for which the longest set of consecutive positive integers, 1 to <i>n</i>, can be obtained, giving your answer as a string: <i>abcd</i>.

### Amicable chains


The proper divisors of a number are all the divisors excluding the number itself. For example, the proper divisors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14. As the sum of these divisors is equal to 28, we call it a perfect number.
Interestingly the sum of the proper divisors of 220 is 284 and the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 220, forming a chain of two numbers. For this reason, 220 and 284 are called an amicable pair.
Perhaps less well known are longer chains. For example, starting with 12496, we form a chain of five numbers:
<p class="center">12496 → 14288 → 15472 → 14536 → 14264 (→ 12496 → ...)
Since this chain returns to its starting point, it is called an amicable chain.
