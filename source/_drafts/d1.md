### Names scores


Using <a href="project/resources/p022_names.txt">names.txt</a> (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score.
For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score of 938 × 53 = 49714.
What is the total of all the name scores in the file?

### Non-abundant sums


A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is exactly equal to the number. For example, the sum of the proper divisors of 28 would be 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28, which means that 28 is a perfect number.
A number <var>n</var> is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less than <var>n</var> and it is called abundant if this sum exceeds <var>n</var>.

As 12 is the smallest abundant number, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, the smallest number that can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers is 24. By mathematical analysis, it can be shown that all integers greater than 28123 can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers. However, this upper limit cannot be reduced any further by analysis even though it is known that the greatest number that cannot be expressed as the sum of two abundant numbers is less than this limit.
Find the sum of all the positive integers which cannot be written as the sum of two abundant numbers.

### Quadratic primes


Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:
<p class="center">$n^2 + n + 41$
It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive integer values $0 \le n \le 39$. However, when $n = 40, 40^2 + 40 + 41 = 40(40 + 1) + 41$ is divisible by 41, and certainly when $n = 41, 41^2 + 41 + 41$ is clearly divisible by 41.
The incredible formula $n^2 - 79n + 1601$ was discovered, which produces 80 primes for the consecutive values $0 \le n \le 79$. The product of the coefficients, −79 and 1601, is −126479.
Considering quadratics of the form:
<blockquote>
$n^2 + an + b$, where $|a| &lt; 1000$ and $|b| \le 1000$<div>where $|n|$ is the modulus/absolute value of $n$e.g. $|11| = 11$ and $|-4| = 4$

### Poker hands


In the card game poker, a hand consists of five cards and are ranked, from lowest to highest, in the following way:
<ul><li><b>High Card</b>: Highest value card.</li>
<li><b>One Pair</b>: Two cards of the same value.</li>
<li><b>Two Pairs</b>: Two different pairs.</li>
<li><b>Three of a Kind</b>: Three cards of the same value.</li>
<li><b>Straight</b>: All cards are consecutive values.</li>
<li><b>Flush</b>: All cards of the same suit.</li>
<li><b>Full House</b>: Three of a kind and a pair.</li>
<li><b>Four of a Kind</b>: Four cards of the same value.</li>
<li><b>Straight Flush</b>: All cards are consecutive values of same suit.</li>
<li><b>Royal Flush</b>: Ten, Jack, Queen, King, Ace, in same suit.</li>
</ul>The cards are valued in the order:2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace.
If two players have the same ranked hands then the rank made up of the highest value wins; for example, a pair of eights beats a pair of fives (see example 1 below). But if two ranks tie, for example, both players have a pair of queens, then highest cards in each hand are compared (see example 4 below); if the highest cards tie then the next highest cards are compared, and so on.

### Lychrel numbers


If we take 47, reverse and add, 47 + 74 = 121, which is palindromic.
Not all numbers produce palindromes so quickly. For example,
<p class="margin_left">349 + 943 = 1292,
1292 + 2921 = 4213
4213 + 3124 = 7337
That is, 349 took three iterations to arrive at a palindrome.
Although no one has proved it yet, it is thought that some numbers, like 196, never produce a palindrome. A number that never forms a palindrome through the reverse and add process is called a Lychrel number. Due to the theoretical nature of these numbers, and for the purpose of this problem, we shall assume that a number is Lychrel until proven otherwise. In addition you are given that for every number below ten-thousand, it will either (i) become a palindrome in less than fifty iterations, or, (ii) no one, with all the computing power that exists, has managed so far to map it to a palindrome. In fact, 10677 is the first number to be shown to require over fifty iterations before producing a palindrome: 4668731596684224866951378664 (53 iterations, 28-digits).
Surprisingly, there are palindromic numbers that are themselves Lychrel numbers; the first example is 4994.

### XOR decryption


Each character on a computer is assigned a unique code and the preferred standard is ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange). For example, uppercase A = 65, asterisk (*) = 42, and lowercase k = 107.
A modern encryption method is to take a text file, convert the bytes to ASCII, then XOR each byte with a given value, taken from a secret key. The advantage with the XOR function is that using the same encryption key on the cipher text, restores the plain text; for example, 65 XOR 42 = 107, then 107 XOR 42 = 65.
For unbreakable encryption, the key is the same length as the plain text message, and the key is made up of random bytes. The user would keep the encrypted message and the encryption key in different locations, and without both "halves", it is impossible to decrypt the message.
Unfortunately, this method is impractical for most users, so the modified method is to use a password as a key. If the password is shorter than the message, which is likely, the key is repeated cyclically throughout the message. The balance for this method is using a sufficiently long password key for security, but short enough to be memorable.
Your task has been made easy, as the encryption key consists of three lower case characters. Using <a href="project/resources/p059_cipher.txt">p059_cipher.txt</a> (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a file containing the encrypted ASCII codes, and the knowledge that the plain text must contain common English words, decrypt the message and find the sum of the ASCII values in the original text.

### Odd period square roots


All square roots are periodic when written as continued fractions and can be written in the form:

$\displaystyle \quad \quad \sqrt{N}=a_0+\frac 1 {a_1+\frac 1 {a_2+ \frac 1 {a3+ \dots}}}$

For example, let us consider $\sqrt{23}:$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{23}=4+\sqrt{23}-4=4+\frac 1 {\frac 1 {\sqrt{23}-4}}=4+\frac 1  {1+\frac{\sqrt{23}-3}7}$

If we continue we would get the following expansion:

$\displaystyle \quad \quad \sqrt{23}=4+\frac 1 {1+\frac 1 {3+ \frac 1 {1+\frac 1 {8+ \dots}}}}$

The process can be summarised as follows:

$\quad \quad a_0=4, \frac 1 {\sqrt{23}-4}=\frac {\sqrt{23}+4} 7=1+\frac {\sqrt{23}-3} 7$
$\quad \quad a_1=1, \frac 7 {\sqrt{23}-3}=\frac {7(\sqrt{23}+3)} {14}=3+\frac {\sqrt{23}-3} 2$
$\quad \quad a_2=3, \frac 2 {\sqrt{23}-3}=\frac {2(\sqrt{23}+3)} {14}=1+\frac {\sqrt{23}-4} 7$
$\quad \quad a_3=1, \frac 7 {\sqrt{23}-4}=\frac {7(\sqrt{23}+4)} 7=8+\sqrt{23}-4$
$\quad \quad a_4=8, \frac 1 {\sqrt{23}-4}=\frac {\sqrt{23}+4} 7=1+\frac {\sqrt{23}-3} 7$
$\quad \quad a_5=1, \frac 7 {\sqrt{23}-3}=\frac {7 (\sqrt{23}+3)} {14}=3+\frac {\sqrt{23}-3} 2$

$\quad \quad a_6=3, \frac 2 {\sqrt{23}-3}=\frac {2(\sqrt{23}+3)} {14}=1+\frac {\sqrt{23}-4} 7$
$\quad \quad a_7=1, \frac 7 {\sqrt{23}-4}=\frac {7(\sqrt{23}+4)} {7}=8+\sqrt{23}-4$

It can be seen that the sequence is repeating. For conciseness, we use the notation $\sqrt{23}=[4;(1,3,1,8)]$, to indicate that the block (1,3,1,8) repeats indefinitely.

The first ten continued fraction representations of (irrational) square roots are:

$\quad \quad \sqrt{2}=[1;(2)]$, period=$1$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{3}=[1;(1,2)]$, period=$2$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{5}=[2;(4)]$, period=$1$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{6}=[2;(2,4)]$, period=$2$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{7}=[2;(1,1,1,4)]$, period=$4$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{8}=[2;(1,4)]$, period=$2$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{10}=[3;(6)]$, period=$1$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{11}=[3;(3,6)]$, period=$2$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{12}=[3;(2,6)]$, period=$2$
$\quad \quad \sqrt{13}=[3;(1,1,1,1,6)]$, period=$5$

Exactly four continued fractions, for $N \le 13$, have an odd period.
How many continued fractions for $N \le 10\,000$ have an odd period?

### Convergents of e


The square root of 2 can be written as an infinite continued fraction.
$\sqrt{2} = 1 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + ...}}}}$
The infinite continued fraction can be written, $\sqrt{2} = [1; (2)]$, $(2)$ indicates that 2 repeats <i>ad infinitum</i>. In a similar way, $\sqrt{23} = [4; (1, 3, 1, 8)]$.
It turns out that the sequence of partial values of continued fractions for square roots provide the best rational approximations. Let us consider the convergents for $\sqrt{2}$.
$\begin{align}
&amp;1 + \dfrac{1}{2} = \dfrac{3}{2} \\
&amp;1 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2}} = \dfrac{7}{5}\\
&amp;1 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2}}} = \dfrac{17}{12}\\
&amp;1 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2 + \dfrac{1}{2}}}} = \dfrac{41}{29}
\end{align}$
Hence the sequence of the first ten convergents for $\sqrt{2}$ are:
$1, \dfrac{3}{2}, \dfrac{7}{5}, \dfrac{17}{12}, \dfrac{41}{29}, \dfrac{99}{70}, \dfrac{239}{169}, \dfrac{577}{408}, \dfrac{1393}{985}, \dfrac{3363}{2378}, ...$
What is most surprising is that the important mathematical constant,$e = [2; 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, ... , 1, 2k, 1, ...]$.
The first ten terms in the sequence of convergents for <i>e</i> are:
$2, 3, \dfrac{8}{3}, \dfrac{11}{4}, \dfrac{19}{7}, \dfrac{87}{32}, \dfrac{106}{39}, \dfrac{193}{71}, \dfrac{1264}{465}, \dfrac{1457}{536}, ...$
The sum of digits in the numerator of the 10<sup>th</sup> convergent is $1 + 4 + 5 + 7 = 17$.
Find the sum of digits in the numerator of the 100<sup>th</sup> convergent of the continued fraction for $e$.

### Diophantine equation


Consider quadratic Diophantine equations of the form:

For example, when D=13, the minimal solution in <i>x</i> is 649<sup>2</sup> – 13×180<sup>2</sup> = 1.
It can be assumed that there are no solutions in positive integers when D is square.
By finding minimal solutions in <i>x</i> for D = {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}, we obtain the following:
<p class="margin_left">3<sup>2</sup> – 2×2<sup>2</sup> = 1
2<sup>2</sup> – 3×1<sup>2</sup> = 1<span class="red strong">9</span><sup>2</sup> – 5×4<sup>2</sup> = 1

### Prime power triples



The smallest number expressible as the sum of a prime square, prime cube, and prime fourth power is 28. In fact, there are exactly four numbers below fifty that can be expressed in such a way:
<p class="margin_left">28 = 2<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>3</sup> + 2<sup>4</sup>
33 = 3<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>3</sup> + 2<sup>4</sup>
49 = 5<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>3</sup> + 2<sup>4</sup>
47 = 2<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>3</sup> + 2<sup>4</sup>
How many numbers below fifty million can be expressed as the sum of a prime square, prime cube, and prime fourth power?

### Product-sum numbers



A natural number, N, that can be written as the sum and product of a given set of at least two natural numbers, {<i>a</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>a</i><sub>2</sub>, ... , <i>a</i><sub><i>k</i></sub>} is called a product-sum number: N = <i>a</i><sub>1</sub> + <i>a</i><sub>2</sub> + ... + <i>a</i><sub><i>k</i></sub> = <i>a</i><sub>1</sub> × <i>a</i><sub>2</sub> × ... × <i>a</i><sub><i>k</i></sub>.
For example, 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 1 × 2 × 3.
For a given set of size, <i>k</i>, we shall call the smallest N with this property a minimal product-sum number. The minimal product-sum numbers for sets of size, <i>k</i> = 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are as follows.
<p class="margin_left"><i>k</i>=2: 4 = 2 × 2 = 2 + 2<i>k</i>=3: 6 = 1 × 2 × 3 = 1 + 2 + 3<i>k</i>=4: 8 = 1 × 1 × 2 × 4 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4<i>k</i>=5: 8 = 1 × 1 × 2 × 2 × 2  = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2<i>k</i>=6: 12 = 1 × 1 × 1 × 1 × 2 × 6 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 6
Hence for 2≤<i>k</i>≤6, the sum of all the minimal product-sum numbers is 4+6+8+12 = 30; note that 8 is only counted once in the sum.
In fact, as the complete set of minimal product-sum numbers for 2≤<i>k</i>≤12 is {4, 6, 8, 12, 15, 16}, the sum is 61.
What is the sum of all the minimal product-sum numbers for 2≤<i>k</i>≤12000?

### Roman numerals


For a number written in Roman numerals to be considered valid there are basic rules which must be followed. Even though the rules allow some numbers to be expressed in more than one way there is always a "best" way of writing a particular number.
For example, it would appear that there are at least six ways of writing the number sixteen:
<p class="margin_left monospace">IIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
VIIIIIIIIIII
VVIIIIII
XIIIIII
VVVI
XVI
However, according to the rules only <span class="monospace">XIIIIII</span> and <span class="monospace">XVI</span> are valid, and the last example is considered to be the most efficient, as it uses the least number of numerals.
The 11K text file, <a href="project/resources/p089_roman.txt">roman.txt</a> (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), contains one thousand numbers written in valid, but not necessarily minimal, Roman numerals; see <a href="about=roman_numerals">About... Roman Numerals</a> for the definitive rules for this problem.
Find the number of characters saved by writing each of these in their minimal form.
<p class="smaller">Note: You can assume that all the Roman numerals in the file contain no more than four consecutive identical units.

### Cube digit pairs


Each of the six faces on a cube has a different digit (0 to 9) written on it; the same is done to a second cube. By placing the two cubes side-by-side in different positions we can form a variety of 2-digit numbers.

For example, the square number 64 could be formed:

### Square digit chains



A number chain is created by continuously adding the square of the digits in a number to form a new number until it has been seen before.
For example,
<p class="margin_left">44 → 32 → 13 → 10 → <b>1</b> → <b>1</b>
85 → <b>89</b> → 145 → 42 → 20 → 4 → 16 → 37 → 58 → <b>89</b>
Therefore any chain that arrives at 1 or 89 will become stuck in an endless loop. What is most amazing is that EVERY starting number will eventually arrive at 1 or 89.
How many starting numbers below ten million will arrive at 89?

### Arithmetic expressions


By using each of the digits from the set, {1, 2, 3, 4}, exactly once, and making use of the four arithmetic operations (+, −, *, /) and brackets/parentheses, it is possible to form different positive integer targets.
For example,
<p class="monospace margin_left">8 = (4 * (1 + 3)) / 2
14 = 4 * (3 + 1 / 2)
19 = 4 * (2 + 3) − 1
36 = 3 * 4 * (2 + 1)
Note that concatenations of the digits, like 12 + 34, are not allowed.
Using the set, {1, 2, 3, 4}, it is possible to obtain thirty-one different target numbers of which 36 is the maximum, and each of the numbers 1 to 28 can be obtained before encountering the first non-expressible number.
Find the set of four distinct digits, <i>a</i> &lt; <i>b</i> &lt; <i>c</i> &lt; <i>d</i>, for which the longest set of consecutive positive integers, 1 to <i>n</i>, can be obtained, giving your answer as a string: <i>abcd</i>.

### Almost equilateral triangles


It is easily proved that no equilateral triangle exists with integral length sides and integral area. However, the <i>almost equilateral triangle</i> 5-5-6 has an area of 12 square units.
We shall define an <i>almost equilateral triangle</i> to be a triangle for which two sides are equal and the third differs by no more than one unit.
Find the sum of the perimeters of all <i>almost equilateral triangles</i> with integral side lengths and area and whose perimeters do not exceed one billion (1,000,000,000).

### Amicable chains


The proper divisors of a number are all the divisors excluding the number itself. For example, the proper divisors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14. As the sum of these divisors is equal to 28, we call it a perfect number.
Interestingly the sum of the proper divisors of 220 is 284 and the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 220, forming a chain of two numbers. For this reason, 220 and 284 are called an amicable pair.
Perhaps less well known are longer chains. For example, starting with 12496, we form a chain of five numbers:
<p class="center">12496 → 14288 → 15472 → 14536 → 14264 (→ 12496 → ...)
Since this chain returns to its starting point, it is called an amicable chain.
Find the smallest member of the longest amicable chain with no element exceeding one million.

### Su Doku


Su Doku (Japanese meaning <i>number place</i>) is the name given to a popular puzzle concept. Its origin is unclear, but credit must be attributed to Leonhard Euler who invented a similar, and much more difficult, puzzle idea called Latin Squares. The objective of Su Doku puzzles, however, is to replace the blanks (or zeros) in a 9 by 9 grid in such that each row, column, and 3 by 3 box contains each of the digits 1 to 9. Below is an example of a typical starting puzzle grid and its solution grid.

### Anagramic squares


By replacing each of the letters in the word CARE with 1, 2, 9, and 6 respectively, we form a square number: 1296 = 36<sup>2</sup>. What is remarkable is that, by using the same digital substitutions, the anagram, RACE, also forms a square number: 9216 = 96<sup>2</sup>. We shall call CARE (and RACE) a square anagram word pair and specify further that leading zeroes are not permitted, neither may a different letter have the same digital value as another letter.

### Arranged probability



If a box contains twenty-one coloured discs, composed of fifteen blue discs and six red discs, and two discs were taken at random, it can be seen that the probability of taking two blue discs, P(BB) = (15/21)×(14/20) = 1/2.
The next such arrangement, for which there is exactly 50% chance of taking two blue discs at random, is a box containing eighty-five blue discs and thirty-five red discs.
By finding the first arrangement to contain over 10<sup>12</sup> = 1,000,000,000,000 discs in total, determine the number of blue discs that the box would contain.
