## 题目
### Sums of Digit Factorials

Define f(<var>n</var>) as the sum of the factorials of the digits of <var>n</var>. For example, f(342) = 3! + 4! + 2! = 32.

Define sf(<var>n</var>) as the sum of the digits of f(<var>n</var>). So sf(342) = 3 + 2 = 5.

Define g(<var>i</var>) to be the smallest positive integer <var>n</var> such that sf(<var>n</var>) = <var>i</var>. Though sf(342) is 5, sf(25) is also 5, and it can be verified that g(5) is 25.

Define sg(<var>i</var>) as the sum of the digits of g(<var>i</var>). So sg(5) = 2 + 5 = 7.

Further, it can be verified that g(20) is 267 and <span style="font-size:larger;"><span style="font-size:larger;">\sum</span></span> sg(<var>i</var>) for 1 \le <var>i</var> \le 20 is 156.

What is <span style="font-size:larger;"><span style="font-size:larger;">\sum</span></span> sg(<var>i</var>) for 1 \le <var>i</var> \le 150?

## 题目
### Sums of Digit Factorials

Define f(n) as the sum of the factorials of the digits of n. For example, f(342) = 3! + 4! + 2! = 32.
Define sf(n) as the sum of the digits of f(n). So sf(342) = 3 + 2 = 5.
Define g(i) to be the smallest positive integer n such that sf(n) = i. Though sf(342) is 5, sf(25) is also 5, and it can be verified that g(5) is 25.
Define sg(i) as the sum of the digits of g(i). So sg(5) = 2 + 5 = 7.
Further, it can be verified that g(20) is 267 and \sum&thinsp;sg(i) for 1 \le i \le 20 is 156.
What is \sum&thinsp;sg(i) for 1 \le i \le 150?
