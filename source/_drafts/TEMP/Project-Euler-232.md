### The Race

Two players share an unbiased coin and take it in turns to play <dfn>The Race</dfn>.

On Player 1's turn, the coin is tossed once. If it comes up Heads, then Player 1 scores one point; if it comes up Tails, then no points are scored.

On Player 2's turn, a positive integer, $T$, is chosen by Player 2 and the coin is tossed $T$ times. If it comes up all Heads, then Player 2 scores $2^{T-1}$ points; otherwise, no points are scored.

Player 1 goes first and the winner is the first to 100 or more points.

Player 2 will always selects the number, $T$, of coin tosses that maximises the probability of winning.

What is the probability that Player 2 wins?

Give your answer rounded to eight decimal places in the form $0.abcdefgh$.

### The Race

Two players share an unbiased coin and take it in turns to play “The Race”. On Player 1’s turn, he tosses the coin once: if it comes up Heads, he scores one point; if it comes up Tails, he scores nothing. On Player 2’s turn, she chooses a positive integer T and tosses the coin T times: if it comes up all Heads, she scores 2^T-1 points; otherwise, she scores nothing. Player 1 goes first. The winner is the first to 100 or more points.
On each turn Player 2 selects the number, T, of coin tosses that maximises the probability of her winning.
What is the probability that Player 2 wins?
Give your answer rounded to eight decimal places in the form 0.<i>abcdefgh</i>.
