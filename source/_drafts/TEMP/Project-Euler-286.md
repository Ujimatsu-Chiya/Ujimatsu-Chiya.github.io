# Project Euler 286
## 题目
### Scoring probabilities

Barbara is a mathematician and a basketball player. She has found that the probability of scoring a point when shooting from a distance <var>x</var> is exactly (1 - ^<var>x</var>/_<var>q</var>), where <var>q</var> is a real constant greater than 50.

During each practice run, she takes shots from distances <var>x</var> = 1, <var>x</var> = 2, \dots, <var>x</var> = 50 and, according to her records, she has precisely a 2 % chance to score a total of exactly 20 points.

Find <var>q</var> and give your answer rounded to 10 decimal places.
