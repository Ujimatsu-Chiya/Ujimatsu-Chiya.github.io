## 题目
### Firecracker



A firecracker explodes at a height of $100 \text{m}$ above level ground. It breaks into a large number of very small fragments, which move in every direction; all of them have the same initial velocity of $20 \text{m/s}$.


We assume that the fragments move without air resistance, in a uniform gravitational field with $g=9.81 \text{m/s}^2$.


Find the volume (in $\text{m}^3$) of the region through which the fragments move before reaching the ground. 

Give your answer rounded to four decimal places.
