## 题目
### Squares under a hyperbola

Consider the region constrained by 1 \le <var>x</var> and 0 \le <var>y</var> \le ^1/_<var>x</var>.

Let S_1 be the largest square that can fit under the curve.<br />
Let S_2 be the largest square that fits in the remaining area, and so on. <br />
Let the <i>index</i> of S_<var>n</var> be the pair (left, below) indicating the number of squares to the left of S_<var>n</var> and the number of squares below S_<var>n</var>.

<div class="center">
<img src="project/images/p247_hypersquares.gif" class="dark_img" alt="" /></div>

The diagram shows some such squares labelled by number. <br />
S_2 has one square to its left and none below, so the index of S_2 is (1,0).<br />
It can be seen that the index of S_32 is (1,1) as is the index of S_50. <br />
50 is the largest <var>n</var> for which the index of S_<var>n</var> is (1,1).


What is the largest <var>n</var> for which the index of S_<var>n</var> is (3,3)?
