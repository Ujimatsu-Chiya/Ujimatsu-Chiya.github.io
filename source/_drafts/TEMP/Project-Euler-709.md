## 题目
### Even Stevens

Every day for the past $n$ days Even Stevens brings home his groceries in a plastic bag. He stores these plastic bags in a cupboard. He either puts the plastic bag into the cupboard with the rest, or else he takes an <b>even</b> number of the existing bags (which may either be empty or previously filled with other bags themselves) and places these into the current bag.

After 4 days there are 5 possible packings and if the bags are numbered 1 (oldest), 2, 3, 4, they are:
<ul><li>Four empty bags,</li>
<li>1 and 2 inside 3, 4 empty,</li>
<li>1 and 3 inside 4, 2 empty,</li>
<li>1 and 2 inside 4, 3 empty,</li>
<li>2 and 3 inside 4, 1 empty.</li>
</ul>Note that 1, 2, 3 inside 4 is invalid because every bag must contain an even number of bags.

Define $f(n)$ to be the number of possible packings of $n$ bags. Hence $f(4)=5$. You are also given $f(8)=1\,385$.

Find $f(24\,680)$ giving your answer modulo $1\,020\,202\,009$.

### Even Stevens

Every day for the past $n$ days Even Stevens brings home his groceries in a plastic bag. He stores these plastic bags in a cupboard. He either puts the plastic bag into the cupboard with the rest, or else he takes an **even** number of the existing bags (which may either be empty or previously filled with other bags themselves) and places these into the current bag.
After $4$ days there are $5$ possible packings and if the bags are numbered $1$ (oldest), $2$, $3$, $4$, they are:
<ul>
<li>Four empty bags,</li>
<li>$1$ and $2$ inside $3$, $4$ empty,</li>
<li>$1$ and $3$ inside $4$, $2$ empty,</li>
<li>$1$ and $2$ inside $4$, $3$ empty,</li>
<li>$2$ and $3$ inside $4$, $1$ empty.</li>
</ul>
Note that $1$, $2$, $3$ inside $4$ is invalid because every bag must contain an even number of bags.
Define $f(n)$ to be the number of possible packings of $n$ bags. Hence $f(4)=5$. You are also given $f(8)=1\ 385$.
Find $f(24\ 680)$ giving your answer modulo $1\ 020\ 202\ 009$.
