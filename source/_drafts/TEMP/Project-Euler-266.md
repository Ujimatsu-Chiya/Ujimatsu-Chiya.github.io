# Project Euler 266
## 题目
### Pseudo Square Root


The divisors of 12 are: 1,2,3,4,6 and 12.<br />
The largest divisor of 12 that does not exceed the square root of 12 is 3.<br />
We shall call the largest divisor of an integer <var>n</var> that does not exceed the square root of <var>n</var> the pseudo square root (PSR) of <var>n</var>.<br />
It can be seen that PSR(3102)=47.


Let <var>p</var> be the product of the primes below 190.<br />
Find PSR(<var>p</var>) mod 10^16.
