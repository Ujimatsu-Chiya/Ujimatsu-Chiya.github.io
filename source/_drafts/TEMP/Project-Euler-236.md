### Luxury Hampers

Suppliers 'A' and 'B' provided the following numbers of products for the luxury hamper market:

Although the suppliers try very hard to ship their goods in perfect condition, there is inevitably some spoilage - <i>i.e.</i> products gone bad.

The suppliers compare their performance using two types of statistic:<ul><li>The five <i>per-product spoilage rates</i> for each supplier are equal to the number of products gone bad divided by the number of products supplied, for each of the five products in turn.</li>

### Luxury Hampers

Suppliers ‘A’ and ‘B’ provided the following numbers of products for the luxury hamper market:
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="center">Product</th>
<th align="center">‘A’</th>
<th align="center">‘B’</th>
</tr>

<tbody><tr>
<td align="center">Beluga Caviar</td>
<td align="center">5248</td>
<td align="center">640</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">Christmas Cake</td>
<td align="center">1312</td>
<td align="center">1888</td>

<td align="center">Gammon Joint</td>
<td align="center">2624</td>
<td align="center">3776</td>

<td align="center">Vintage Port</td>
<td align="center">5760</td>
<td align="center">3776</td>

<tr>
<td align="center">Champagne Truffles</td>
<td align="center">3936</td>
<td align="center">5664</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
Although the suppliers try very hard to ship their goods in perfect condition, there is inevitably some spoilage - <i>i.e.</i> products gone bad.
The suppliers compare their performance using two types of statistic:
<ul>
<li>The five <i>per-product spoilage rates</i> for each supplier are equal to the number of products gone bad divided by the number of products supplied, for each of the five products in turn.</li>
<li>The <i>overall spoilage rate</i> for each supplier is equal to the total number of products gone bad divided by the total number of products provided by that supplier.</li>
</ul>
To their surprise, the suppliers found that each of the five per-product spoilage rates was worse (higher) for ‘B’ than for ‘A’ by the same factor (ratio of spoilage rates), m>1; and yet, paradoxically, the overall spoilage rate was worse for ‘A’ than for ‘B’, also by a factor of m.
There are thirty-five m>1 for which this surprising result could have occurred, the smallest of which is 1476/1475.
What’s the largest possible value of m?<br>Give your answer as a fraction reduced to its lowest terms, in the form u/v.
