## 题目
### Chip Defects


<var>k</var> defects are randomly distributed amongst <var>n</var> integrated-circuit chips produced by a factory (any number of defects may be found on a chip and each defect is independent of the other defects).


Let p(<var>k,n</var>) represent the probability that there is a chip with at least 3 defects.<br />
For instance p(3,7) ≈ 0.0204081633.


Find p(20 000, 1 000 000) and give your answer rounded to 10 decimal places in the form 0.abcdefghij
