## 题目
### Concave triangle


A square is drawn around a circle as shown in the diagram below on the left.<br />
We shall call the blue shaded region the L-section.<br />
A line is drawn from the bottom left of the square to the top right as shown in the diagram on the right.<br />
We shall call the orange shaded region a concave triangle.

<div class="center">
<img src="project/images/p587_concave_triangle_1.png" class="dark_img" alt="p587_concave_triangle_1.png" /></div>

It should be clear that the concave triangle occupies exactly half of the L-section.



Two circles are placed next to each other horizontally, a rectangle is drawn around both circles, and a line is drawn from the bottom left to the top right as shown in the diagram below.

<div class="center">
<img src="project/images/p587_concave_triangle_2.png" class="dark_img" alt="p587_concave_triangle_2.png" /></div>

This time the concave triangle occupies approximately 36.46% of the L-section.


If <var>n</var> circles are placed next to each other horizontally, a rectangle is drawn around the <var>n</var> circles, and a line is drawn from the bottom left to the top right, then it can be shown that the least value of <var>n</var> for which the concave triangle occupies less than 10% of the L-section is <var>n</var> = 15.


What is the least value of <var>n</var> for which the concave triangle occupies less than 0.1% of the L-section?

This time the concave triangle occupies approximately 36.46% of the L-section.
If $n$ circles are placed next to each other horizontally, a rectangle is drawn around the $n$ circles, and a line is drawn from the bottom left to the top right, then it can be shown that the least value of $n$ for which the concave triangle occupies less than 10% of the L-section is $n$ = 15.
What is the least value of $n$ for which the concave triangle occupies less than 0.1% of the L-section?
