## 题目
### Nim Square


Alice and Bob play the game Nim Square.<br />
Nim Square is just like ordinary three-heap normal play Nim, but the players may only remove a square number of stones from a heap.<br />
The number of stones in the three heaps is represented by the ordered triple (a,b,c).<br />
If 0\lea\leb\lec\le29 then the number of losing positions for the next player is 1160.


Find the number of losing positions for the next player if 0\lea\leb\lec\le100 000.
