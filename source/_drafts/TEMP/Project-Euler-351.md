## 题目
### Hexagonal orchards

A <i>hexagonal orchard</i> of order <var>n</var> is a triangular lattice made up of points within a regular hexagon with side <var>n</var>. The following is an example of a hexagonal orchard of order 5:


<div align="center">
<img src="project/images/p351_hexorchard.png" class="dark_img" alt="p351_hexorchard.png" /><br /></div>


Highlighted in green are the points which are hidden from the center by a point closer to it. It can be seen that for a hexagonal orchard of order 5, 30 points are hidden from the center.



Let H(<var>n</var>) be the number of points hidden from the center in a hexagonal orchard of order <var>n</var>.



H(5) = 30. H(10) = 138. H(1 000) = 1177848.



Find H(100 000 000).

Let H(n) be the number of points hidden from the center in a hexagonal orchard of order n.
H(5) = 30. H(10) = 138. H(1 000) = 1177848.
Find H(100 000 000).
