## 题目
### Generalised Hamming Numbers

A Hamming number is a positive number which has no prime factor larger than 5.<br />
So the first few Hamming numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15.<br />
There are 1105 Hamming numbers not exceeding 10^8.

We will call a positive number a generalised Hamming number of type <var>n</var>, if it has no prime factor larger than <var>n</var>.<br />
Hence the Hamming numbers are the generalised Hamming numbers of type 5.

How many generalised Hamming numbers of type 100 are there which don't exceed 10^9?
