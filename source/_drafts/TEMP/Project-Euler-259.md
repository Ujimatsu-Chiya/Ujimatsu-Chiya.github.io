## 题目
### Reachable Numbers

A positive integer will be called <i>reachable</i> if it can result from an arithmetic expression obeying the following rules:

<ul><li>Uses the digits 1 through 9, in that order and exactly once each.</li>
<li>Any successive digits can be concatenated (for example, using the digits 2, 3 and 4 we obtain the number 234).</li>
<li>Only the four usual binary arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) are allowed.</li>
<li>Each operation can be used any number of times, or not at all.</li>
<li><dfn title="A minus sign applied to a single operand (as opposed to a subtraction operator between two operands)">Unary minus</dfn> is not allowed.</li>
<li>Any number of (possibly nested) parentheses may be used to define the order of operations.</li>
</ul>For example, 42 is reachable, since (1/23) * ((4*5)-6) * (78-9) = 42.

What is the sum of all positive reachable integers?
