# Project Euler 241
## 题目
### Perfection Quotients

For a positive integer $n$, let $\sigma(n)$ be the sum of all divisors of $n$. For example, $\sigma(6) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12$.

A perfect number, as you probably know, is a number with $\sigma(n) = 2n$.

Let us define the <b>perfection quotient</b> of a positive integer as $p(n) = \dfrac{\sigma(n)}{n}$.

Find the sum of all positive integers $n \le 10^{18}$ for which $p(n)$ has the form $k + \dfrac{1}{2}$, where $k$ is an integer.

### Perfection Quotients

For a positive integer n, let σ(n) be the sum of all divisors of n, so e.g. σ(6) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12.
A perfect number, as you probably know, is a number with σ(n) = 2n.
Let us define the <b>perfection quotient</b> of a positive integer as p(n)= $\frac{\sigma(n)}{n}$
Find the sum of all positive integers n \le 10^18 for which p(n) has the form k + ^1⁄_2, where k is an integer.
