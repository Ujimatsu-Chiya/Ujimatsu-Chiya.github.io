## 题目
### Langton's ant


An ant moves on a regular grid of squares that are coloured either black or white.<br /> 
The ant is always oriented in one of the cardinal directions (left, right, up or down) and moves from square to adjacent square according to the following rules:<br />
- if it is on a black square, it flips the colour of the square to white, rotates 90 degrees counterclockwise and moves forward one square.<br />
- if it is on a white square, it flips the colour of the square to black, rotates 90 degrees clockwise and moves forward one square.<br />

Starting with a grid that is entirely white, how many squares are black after 10^18 moves of the ant?
