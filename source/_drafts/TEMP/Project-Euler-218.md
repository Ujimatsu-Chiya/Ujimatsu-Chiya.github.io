## 题目
### Perfect right-angled triangles

Consider the right angled triangle with sides $a=7, b=24$ and $c=25$. The area of this triangle is $84$, which is divisible by the perfect numbers $6$ and $28$. 

Moreover it is a primitive right angled triangle as $\gcd(a,b)=1$ and $\gcd(b,c)=1$.

Also $c$ is a perfect square.
We will call a right angled triangle perfect if

- it is a primitive right angled triangle
- its hypotenuse is a perfect square

We will call a right angled triangle super-perfect if

 - it is a perfect right angled triangle and
 - its area is a multiple of the perfect numbers $6$ and $28$.

How many perfect right-angled triangles with $c\le10^{16}$ exist that are not super-perfect?
