## 题目
### Perfect right-angled triangles

Consider the right angled triangle with sides a=7, b=24 and c=25.
The area of this triangle is 84, which is divisible by the perfect numbers 6 and 28.<br />
Moreover it is a primitive right angled triangle as gcd(a,b)=1 and gcd(b,c)=1.<br />
Also c is a perfect square.

We will call a right angled triangle perfect if<br />
-it is a primitive right angled triangle<br />
-its hypotenuse is a perfect square

We will call a right angled triangle super-perfect if<br />
-it is a perfect right angled triangle and<br />
-its area is a multiple of the perfect numbers 6 and 28.


How many perfect right-angled triangles with c\le10^16 exist that are not super-perfect?
