# Project Euler 215
## 题目
### Crack-free Walls

Consider the problem of building a wall out of 2\times1 and 3\times1 bricks (horizontal\timesvertical dimensions) such that, for extra strength, the gaps between horizontally-adjacent bricks never line up in consecutive layers, i.e. never form a "running crack".

For example, the following 9\times3 wall is not acceptable due to the running crack shown in red:

<div class="center">
<img src="project/images/p215_crackfree.gif" class="dark_img" alt="" /></div>

There are eight ways of forming a crack-free 9\times3 wall, written W(9,3) = 8.

Calculate W(32,10).
