## 题目
### Crack-free Walls


Consider the problem of building a wall out of $2\times1$ and $3\times1$ bricks (horizontal\timesvertical dimensions) such that, for extra strength, the gaps between horizontally-adjacent bricks never line up in consecutive layers, i.e. never form a "running crack".

For example, the following $9\times3$ wall is not acceptable due to the running crack shown in red:

There are eight ways of forming a crack-free $9\times3$ wall, written $W(9,3) = 8$.

Calculate $W(32,10)$.
