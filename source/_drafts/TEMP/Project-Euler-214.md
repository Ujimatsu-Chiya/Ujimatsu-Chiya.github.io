## 题目
### Totient Chains

Let φ be Euler's totient function, i.e. for a natural number <var>n</var>,
φ(<var>n</var>) is the number of <var>k</var>, 1 \le <var>k</var> \le <var>n</var>, for which gcd(<var>k</var>,<var>n</var>) = 1.

By iterating φ, each positive integer generates a decreasing chain of numbers ending in 1.<br />
E.g. if we start with 5 the sequence 5,4,2,1 is generated.<br />
Here is a listing of all chains with length 4:

<div style="text-align:right;margin-right:350px;">
5,4,2,1<br />
7,6,2,1<br />
8,4,2,1<br />
9,6,2,1<br />
10,4,2,1<br />
12,4,2,1<br />
14,6,2,1<br />
18,6,2,1</div>

Only two of these chains start with a prime, their sum is 12.

What is the sum of all primes less than 40000000 which generate a chain of length 25?
