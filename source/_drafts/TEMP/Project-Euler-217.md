## 题目
### Balanced Numbers


A positive integer with <var>k</var> (decimal) digits is called balanced if its first ⌈^<var>k</var>/_2⌉ digits sum to the same value as its last ⌈^<var>k</var>/_2⌉ digits, where ⌈<var>x</var>⌉, pronounced <span style="font-style:italic;">ceiling</span> of <var>x</var>, is the smallest integer \ge <var>x</var>, thus ⌈π⌉ = 4 and ⌈5⌉ = 5.
So, for example, all palindromes are balanced, as is 13722.
Let T(<var>n</var>) be the sum of all balanced numbers less than 10^<var>n</var>. <br />
Thus: T(1) = 45, T(2) = 540 and T(5) = 334795890. 
Find T(47) mod 3^15

### Balanced Numbers

A positive integer with k (decimal) digits is called balanced if its first ⌈^k/_2⌉ digits sum to the same value as its last ⌈^k/_2⌉ digits, where ⌈x⌉, pronounced <i>ceiling</i> of x, is the smallest integer \ge x, thus ⌈π⌉ = 4 and ⌈5⌉ = 5.
So, for example, all palindromes are balanced, as is 13722.
Let T(n) be the sum of all balanced numbers less than 10^n.<br>Thus: T(1) = 45, T(2) = 540 and T(5) = 334795890. 
Find T(47) mod 3^15.
