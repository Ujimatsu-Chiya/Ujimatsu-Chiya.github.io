# Project Euler 208
## 题目
### Robot Walks

A robot moves in a series of one-fifth circular arcs (72°), with a free choice of a clockwise or an anticlockwise arc for each step, but no turning on the spot.

One of 70932 possible closed paths of 25 arcs starting northward is
<div class="center">
<img src="project/images/p208_robotwalk.gif" class="dark_img" alt="" /></div>

Given that the robot starts facing North, how many journeys of 70 arcs in length can it take that return it, after the final arc, to its starting position?<br />
(Any arc may be traversed multiple times.)
