# Project Euler 294
## 题目
### Sum of digits - experience #23


For a positive integer k, define d(k) as the sum of the digits of k in its usual decimal representation.
Thus d(42) = 4+2 = 6.


For a positive integer n, define S(n) as the number of positive integers k < 10^n with the following properties :
<ul><li>k is divisible by 23 and
</li><li>d(k) = 23.
</li></ul>
You are given that S(9) = 263626 and S(42) = 6377168878570056.


Find S(11^12) and give your answer mod 10^9.
