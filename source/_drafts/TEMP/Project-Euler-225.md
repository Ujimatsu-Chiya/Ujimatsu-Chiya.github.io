## 题目
### Tribonacci non-divisors


The sequence 1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 9, 17, 31, 57, 105, 193, 355, 653, 1201 \dots<br />
is defined by T_1 = T_2 = T_3 = 1 and T_<var>n</var> = T_<var>n</var>-1 + T_<var>n</var>-2 + T_<var>n</var>-3.


It can be shown that 27 does not divide any terms of this sequence.<br />In fact, 27 is the first odd number with this property.

Find the 124^th odd number that does not divide any terms of the above sequence.
