## 题目
### Integer partition equations

For some positive integers <var>k</var>, there exists an integer partition of the form   4^t = 2^t + <var>k</var>,<br />
where 4^t, 2^t, and <var>k</var> are all positive integers and <var>t</var> is a real number.

The first two such partitions are 4^1 = 2^1 + 2 and 4^1.5849625\dots = 2^1.5849625\dots + 6.

Partitions where <var>t</var> is also an integer are called <i>perfect</i>.<br /> 
For any <var>m</var> \ge 1 let P(<var>m</var>) be the proportion of such partitions that are perfect with <var>k</var> \le <var>m</var>.<br />
Thus P(6) = 1/2.

In the following table are listed some values of P(<var>m</var>)
   P(5) = 1/1<br />
   P(10) = 1/2<br />
   P(15) = 2/3<br />
   P(20) = 1/2<br />
   P(25) = 1/2<br />
   P(30) = 2/5<br />
   \dots<br />
   P(180) = 1/4<br />
   P(185) = 3/13


Find the smallest <var>m</var> for which P(<var>m</var>) < 1/12345

### Integer partition equations

For some positive integers k, there exists an integer partition of the form&nbsp;&nbsp; 4^t = 2^t + k,<br>where 4^t, 2^t, and k are all positive integers and t is a real number.
The first two such partitions are 4^1 = 2^1 + 2 and 4^1.5849625\dots = 2^1.5849625\dots + 6.
Partitions where t is also an integer are called <i>perfect</i>.<br>For any m \ge 1 let P(m) be the proportion of such partitions that are perfect with k \le m.<br>Thus P(6) = 1/2.
In the following table are listed some values of P(m)
<blockquote>
P(5) = 1/1<br>P(10) = 1/2<br>P(15) = 2/3<br>P(20) = 1/2<br>P(25) = 1/2<br>P(30) = 2/5<br>\dots<br>P(180) = 1/4<br>P(185) = 3/13
</blockquote>
Find the smallest m for which P(m) < 1/12345
