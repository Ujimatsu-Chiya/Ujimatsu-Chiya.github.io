### A Scoop of Blancmange

The *blancmange curve* is the set of points $(x, y)$ such that $0 \le x \le 1$ and $y = \sum \limits_{n = 0}^{\infty} {\dfrac{s(2^n x)}{2^n}}$, where $s(x)$ is the distance from $x$ to the nearest integer.

The area under the blancmange curve is equal to $\dfrac{1}{2}$, shown in pink in the diagram below.

Let $C$ be the circle with centre $(\dfrac{1}{4},\dfrac{1}{2})$ and radius $\dfrac{1}{4}$, shown in black in the diagram.

What area under the blancmange curve is enclosed by C?

Give your answer rounded to eight decimal places in the form *0.abcdefgh*
