## 题目
### Sum of a square and a cube

Many numbers can be expressed as the sum of a square and a cube. Some of them in more than one way.

Consider the palindromic numbers that can be expressed as the sum of a square and a cube, both greater than 1, in <b>exactly</b> 4 different ways.<br />
For example, 5229225 is a palindromic number and it can be expressed in exactly 4 different ways:
2285^2 + 20^3<br />
2223^2 + 66^3<br />
1810^2 + 125^3<br />
1197^2 + 156^3
 
Find the sum of the five smallest such palindromic numbers.
